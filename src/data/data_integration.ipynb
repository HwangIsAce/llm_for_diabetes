       " \"Hello, Thanks for posting your query on Healthcare Magic...* Brief Answer: breast implants have nothing to do with your cardiac management.*Explanation: My opinion is that in your condition, You seem to be in a stable state , from cardiology point of view, if you are on an medications , anti failure ,etc. you should stick on them. any future surgeries you should inform your physician about your cardiac condition and he or she will assess your case .I suggest my patients the following: breast implants do not affect your cardiac condition, but you should inform the anesthesiologist about last cardiac medications and investigation .The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about the medication you are on and other comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension , etc.*Conclusion: I suggest you shouldn't be worried about breast implant, nothing to do with your heart.   If you have any further questions I will be happy to help, If not, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish you good health.\",\n",
       " \"Good day and thanks for your question. Corn can be difficult to treat and am sure your doctors might have tried removing it medically before removing it surgically for you. If not I'll suggest you consult a Dermatologist who would be able to treat you medically by debriding the corn with keratolytics. You should wear less traumatic foot wears, you can take Ibuprofen 400mg 3 times daily for the pain (if you do not have peptic ulcer disease).Check your blood sugar level to be sure you are not diabetic and your doctors would also check whether you do not have Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hope it helps. Thank you.\",\n",
       " 'Hello,Yes fever with chills, pressure in pelvic area before an urge to urinate definitely goes in favor of urinary tract infection more significantly cystitis ( bladder infection). It is more seen in association with conditions like high blood pressure (for which you are taking the medicines), diabetes or spinal injury or urinary stones. Fever indicates bacterial infection for this you need urine analysis report along with other investigations advised by an expert. Antibiotic like Norfloxacin along with alkaline syrup with lot of water usually relieves the symptoms in few days. But as the condition is likely to become recurrent and chronic, full course of medicines are needed to cure it.Please consult your family physician. Drinking sufficient water and genital hygiene are important to prevent recurrence.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Vasudha Jayant Athavale']"
