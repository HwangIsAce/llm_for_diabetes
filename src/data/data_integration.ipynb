In others, keeping the undersurface of foreskin clean once a day while having a bath is enough. It is not necessary to pull back foreskin every time you urinate. Even shaking the penis after urination does not affect smegma. In normal persons, cleaning the undersurface of foreskin once a day suffices.',\n",

According to your statement, you have been suffering from a few painful, hard bumps at the back right of the tongue, and in front of the right tonsil and feel uncomfortable during swallowing. Usually inflamed papillae or taste buds are small, painful bumps that appear after an injury from a bite or irritation from the hot foods. Herpes is a common viral infection that can develop blisters on the tongue or gums. Oral herpes is contagious and can spread through saliva, direct contact, sexual exposure, etc. Canker sores may appear on the tongue which are red, white or yellow in appearance and can feel raw and very painful. Some foods seem to trigger cankers sore. Again food intolerances and allergic reactions may cause bumps on the tongue and it may swollen. An infection in the mouth or on the tongue may cause swelling and pain at the site of the infection. People with syphilis sometimes develop tongue sore as an early symptom of the disease and can contract the infection through direct contact during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. People with oral thrush usually notice rough white patches on the tongue and there is often redness and a sour mouth as well. It can result from DM (diabetes mellitus), HIV, nutritional deficiencies, some medications like corticosteroid, etc. Even TB (tuberculosis), carcinoma can develop bumps on the tongue. Treatment depends on the causes of the bumps. You can use antifungal medication, antibiotics, antiviral medication, and maintain good oral hygiene. You should provide some additional history like smoking, substance abuse, previous disease, medications, history of sexual activities, fever. etc.',\n",
       " 'Hello. At 38 weeks of pregnancy when the head is a cephalic presentation but not yet fixed in the pelvis and there are no decelerations or fetal distress on CTG monitoring and if you do not have any high-risk factor-like IHCP or gestational hypertension with pre-eclampsia then there is actually no need to be induced before the labor starts naturally. There are certain set criteria for induction at 38 weeks or before as mentioned above, else at 39 weeks gestational diabetes, and at 40 weeks plus three days, if post diatoms and no labor initiated naturally, then induction should be done. I do not see any reason why you should be induced at present with AFI normal and heart rate acceptable. At this stage more than heart rate, CTG tracing is more important to assess the fetal well being. So please review with reports and ultrasound and CTG tracing or please furnish details of this being a high-risk pregnancy.',\n",
       " \"Hello. This is the age where you get posterior vitreous detachment. It is a naturally occurring age-related phenomenon where the vitreous jelly separates from one's retina and in this process, one might experience a ring-like floater and probably some flashes. Some warning signs you can watch out if there is something abnormal: If these occur, please consult a vitreoretinal expert ophthalmologist for a dilated fundus examination to rule out any areas of weakness in the retina. Till then, start Nepafenac eye drops once at bedtime to hasten the PVD process. For more information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/eye-care-ophthalmologist\"]"
