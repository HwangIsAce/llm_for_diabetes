      "\n",
      "1. **Coherence (3.0)**:\n",
      "   - The model's response maintains some coherence with the input context, as it covers the key events and medical procedures mentioned in the conversation between the doctor and the patient.\n",
      "   - However, there are significant deviations and inaccuracies, such as the incorrect age of the patient (65-year-old instead of 70-year-old), mentioning diabetes mellitus type 1 instead of type 2, and fabricating information about coronary artery disease which was not mentioned in the input or the true answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Completeness (2.5)**:\n",
      "   - The model's response partially addresses the events and medical history discussed in the input.\n",
      "   - It mentions the key surgeries and fractures accurately but misses critical details like the specific implant models used, and it introduces incorrect information about the patient's medical conditions.\n",
      "   - The hallucinations significantly impact the completeness score as they lead to misleading or incorrect details being included in the summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Naturalness (3.0)**:\n",
      "   - The response maintains a somewhat natural flow in terms of structure and language.\n",
      "   - Although the structure is coherent, the inclusion of hallucinated information like the fabricated medical conditions and inaccurate details affects the naturalness of the response.\n",
      "   - The response lacks the precision and factual accuracy necessary to sound truly human-like.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the summarization model's response is penalized for hallucinations that led to factual inaccuracies and deviations from the input and true answer, resulting in lower scores for coherence, completeness, and naturalness.

      "Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Coherence**:\n",
      "   The model's response lacks coherence as it introduces hallucinations such as the patient's age being different, presenting symptoms not fully aligned with the true answer, and mentions of surgical intervention which were not mentioned in the input or the true answer. These discrepancies result in a lack of alignment with the context provided.\n",

      "   The response covers some key aspects mentioned in the input and the true answer, but there are significant deviations and added details that are not supported by the original information. The model includes information about a surgical intervention that was not part of the original conversation, leading to a misleading portrayal of the treatment plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Naturalness**:\n",
      "   The response maintains a moderate level of naturalness in terms of language fluency and coherence. However, due to the inclusion of hallucinated details and fabricated information, the response deviates from a realistic and human-like representation of the provided dialogue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the model's response demonstrates significant issues in coherence, completeness, and naturalness due to the presence of hallucinated or fabricated information, which negatively impacts the overall quality of the summary.\n"
