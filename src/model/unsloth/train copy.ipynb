In this study, we aimed to investigate whether tranilast exerts its anti-oxidant properties through the inhibition of Txnip. Heterozygous Ren-2 rats were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin. Another group of rats were injected with citrate buffer alone and treated as non-diabetic controls. After 6 weeks of diabetes, diabetic rats were divided into two groups: one group gavaged with tranilast at 200 mg/kg/day and another group with vehicle. Diabetic rats had a significant increase in albuminuria, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, peritubular collagen IV accumulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and macrophage infiltration (all P < 0.05). These changes were associated with an increase in Txnip mRNA and protein expression in the tubules and glomeruli of diabetic kidney. Treatment with tranilast for 4 weeks significantly attenuated Txnip up-regulation in diabetic rats and this was associated with a reduction in ROS, fibrosis and macrophage infiltration (all P < 0.05).', 'output': 'yes', 'text_length': 1694, '__index_level_0__': 45377}\n",

Context: Diabetes mellitus is prevalent among kidney transplant recipients. The activity of drug metabolizing enzymes or transporters may be altered by diabetes leading to changes in the concentration of parent drug or metabolites. This study was aimed to characterize the effect of diabetes on the concentration of cyclosporine (CsA) and metabolites. Concentration-time profiles of CsA and metabolites (AM1, AM9, AM4N, AM1c, AM19, and AM1c9) were characterized over a 12-hour dosing interval in 10 nondiabetic and 7 diabetic stable kidney transplant recipients. All patients were male, had nonfunctional CYP3A5*3 genotype, and were on combination therapy with ketoconazole. The average daily dose (±SD) of CsA was 65 ± 21 and 68 ± 35 mg in nondiabetic and diabetic subjects, respectively (P = 0.550). Cyclosporine metabolites that involved amino acid 1 (AM1, AM19, AM1c) exhibited significantly lower dose-normalized values of area under the concentration-time curve in patients with diabetes. Moreover, during the postabsorption phase (≥3 hours after dose), metabolite-parent concentration ratios for all metabolites, except AM4N, was significantly lower in diabetic patients. The pharmacokinetic parameters of ketoconazole were similar between the 2 groups thus excluding inconsistent ketoconazole exposure as a source of altered CsA metabolism.', 'output': 'yes', 'text_length': 1584, '__index_level_0__': 45389}\n",

A cross-sectional study? Context: The quality of recording of clinical data in diabetes care in general practices is very variable. It has been suggested that better recording leads to improved glycaemic control. The purpose of this study was to assess the completeness of recording by GPs of data from type 2 diabetes patients; to compare recorded and missing data; and to investigate the association between completeness and glycaemic control. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 52 general practices. Medical records were scrutinized for the presence of 11 variables. Examining patients through an active approach completed incomplete records. We compared recorded and unrecorded items. Completeness of recording was determined at both patient and practice levels. Fifty-two general practices with 1641 type 2 diabetes patients cared for by the GP participated. The frequency of absence of any particular item ranged from 20 to 70%. Weight, systolic blood pressure and HbA(1c) were slightly lower in patients with those items missing on their files, and more such patients were non-smokers (P < 0.05).

treatment differences were seen with greater cholesterol reductions for the full - nut dose compared with muffins for total cholesterol ( 0.24 mmol / l , 95% ci 0.44 to 0.04 , p < 0.001 ) ; ldl cholesterol ( 0.22 mmol / l , 0.41 to 0.03 , p < 0.001 ) ( supplementary fig . 2 ) ; and total cholesterol : hdl cholesterol ( 0.23 , 0.47 to 0.02 , p = 0.006 ) ( table 2 and supplementary table 3 ) . \\n all three diets significantly raised the hdl cholesterol ( full - nut dose : 0.04 mmol / l , 0.010.08 , p = 0.017 ; half - nut dose : 0.03 mmol / l , 0.000.06 , p = 0.025 ; and muffins : 0.03 mmol / l , 0.010.05 , p = 0.012 ) . \\n nut intake related negatively to total cholesterol ( r = 0.19 , n = 115 , p = 0.039 ) and ldl cholesterol ( r = 0.24 , n = 115 , p = 0.011 ) . through a regression analysis , the full - dose nut intake \\n adjustment for lipid medications still resulted in a significant ldl cholesterol difference between full - nut dose and muffins ( p = 0.007 ) . \\n apob showed a greater reduction on full - nut dose versus muffins ( p < 0.001 ) and half - nut dose versus muffins ( p = 0.012 ) as did the apob : apoa1 ratio ( full - nut dose versus muffins , p = 0.004 , and half - nut dose versus muffins , p = 0.001 ) ( table 2 ) . \\n nut intake related to a reduction in apob ( r = 0.26 , n = 115 , p = 0.006 ) . \\n no significant differences were seen between treatments for crp ( table 2 and supplementary table 3 ) or measures of oxidative damage ( data not shown ) . \\n blood pressure difference was not significant with or without adjustment for blood pressure medication use . \\n increased mixed nut consumption as a source of unsaturated ( monounsaturated and polyunsaturated ) fat intake to replace dietary starch favorably affected both hba1c and serum lipids . \\n these data provide a specific food option for individuals wishing to lower the carbohydrate content of the diet in type 2 diabetes . \\n recently , there has been renewed interest in reducing carbohydrate content in the diet of diabetic patients . in 1994 , on the basis of emerging evidence ( 17 ) , the american diabetes association first suggested the possibility of exchanging dietary carbohydrate for mufa in dietary recommendations for type 2 diabetes ( 18 ) . \\n although not all studies have shown beneficial effects of mufas in diabetes ( 19 ) , general interest has persisted , especially in the context of the mediterranean diet . \\n however , low carbohydrate intakes have also been achieved on the atkins diet by increasing animal fats and proteins . \\n this influential dietary pattern is reflected in the relatively lower prestudy carbohydrate intakes of 45% in the current study rather than the 5060% once recommended ( 20,21 ) . \\n cohort studies have provided additional support showing that higher vegetable fat and protein intakes are associated with a reduced risk of developing diabetes and chd ( 2 ) . \\n furthermore , neither in the current study nor in previous reports has nut consumption been associated with weight gain ( 22 ) . if anything , nuts appear to be well suited as part of weight - reducing diets . \\n the reduction in hba1c was achieved despite baseline hba1c concentrations , which on entry were close to the target of < 7.0% in participants who were already treated with one or more ( average 1.5 ) antihyperglycemic medications . \\n furthermore , a reduction in ldl cholesterol was achieved even though the majority of subjects ( 84/117 , or 72% ) were already taking statins and had low mean baseline ldl cholesterol concentrations of 2.03 \\n mmol / l ( 95% ci 1.902.16 ) . the full - nut dose reduced hba1c by two - thirds of the reduction recognized as clinically meaningful by the u.s . food and drug administration ( > 0.3% absolute hba1c units ) in the development of antihyperglycemic drugs ( 23 ) . \\n in addition , the number of participants who achieved an hba1c concentration of > 7% ( 19 prestudy participants , down to 13 poststudy participants ) was significantly greater on the nut treatment than on the muffin treatment ( 20 prestudy participants , remaining at 20 poststudy participants , mantel - haenszel test , p = 0.040 ) . based on data from the uk prospective diabetes study and the advance study ( 24 ) , the hba1c reduction for the full - nut dose would translate into a predicted 78% reduction in microvascular complications . \\n methodological weaknesses included use of a 7-day diet history with the errors and inaccurateness associated with self - reported data , lack of blinding for participants and dietitians , and the attempt to demonstrate a dose response to nuts when the primary objective of establishing whether nuts improved glycemic control had not first been demonstrated . \\n in addition , in the current study , nut consumption was substantial ( 37.5 g for the half - nut dose and 75 g/2,000 kcal ) for the full - nut dose . \\n however , the baseline nut intake was 12 g / day , and the compliance levels were high ( i.e. , 95.7 and 97.3% for the full - nut and half - nut groups , respectively ) . \\n therefore , we believe that , with the appropriate advice , nut intake at these levels can be achieved and maintained . furthermore , the resulting relative increase in mufa intake was modest at 8.7% of total calories for the full - nut dose . \\n the strengths of the study include its novelty as one of the first studies to assess nuts in type 2 diabetes coupled with measurement of hba1c and blood lipids at three time points in the last month to increase the validity of the assessment of blood lipids and glycemic control . \\n there was good compliance with the supplement and a dropout rate of 12% , which was lower than that seen in many other longer - term diet trials ( 25 ) . \\n finally , there is a requirement for pharmacological interventions aimed at improving glycemic control to demonstrate that they have no negative impact on chd ( 23 ) . in this respect , \\n we have no explanation for the lack of antioxidant effects of nuts seen with previous studies but may relate to antioxidants in wheat bran and apple concentrate used in the muffins . \\n we conclude that mixed , unsalted , raw , or dry - roasted nuts have benefits for both blood glucose control and blood lipids and may be used to increase vegetable oil and protein intake in the diets of type 2 diabetic patients as part of a strategy to improve diabetes control without weight gain .', 'output': 'objectivefat intake , especially monounsaturated fatty acid ( mufa ) , has been liberalized in diabetic diets to preserve hdl cholesterol and improve glycemic control , yet the exact sources have not been clearly defined . \\n therefore , we assessed the effect of mixed nut consumption as a source of vegetable fat on serum lipids and hba1c in type 2 diabetes.research design and methodsa total of 117 type 2 diabetic subjects were randomized to one of three treatments for 3 months . \\n supplements were provided at 475 kcal per 2,000-kcal diet as mixed nuts ( 75 g / day ) , muffins , or half portions of both . \\n the primary outcome was change in hba1c.resultsthe relative increase in mufas was 8.7% energy on the full -

phase images compared with the out - phase images . \\n this occurs because the echo time of the in - phase sequence is usually higher than that of the out - phase sequence ; therefore , the in - phase pulse sequence is more sensitive to iron deposits because of the increased t2 * effect . in the current study , \\n the single breath t2 * gradient echo sequence was preferred for its short scanning time making it more convenient in young age and the resulting signal intensity was compared to that on t2wi . \\n dual phase imaging including in- and out - phase gradient mr imaging was used in five cases to differentiate tissue iron overload from suspected steatosis which demonstrates signal intensity drop in the out - phase sequence and we did not detect any cases of hepatic steatosis in our study .   in the present study , \\n there is significantly lower signal intensity of the liver ( 45/50 ) and pancreas ( 21/50 ) in thalassemic patients compared to controls on t2*gre images and in the in -

10% of the cases with cd . in the present study , 30 ( 14% ) of the 215 patients with cd had pituitary macroadenoma , proportion of patients with macroadenoma was higher among the earlier group ( 20% vs. 12% ) compared with patients diagnosed more recently . \\n there was a significant female preponderance in all etiological groups except eas , like other published series . \\n the number of patients diagnosed cs per year ( 8 vs. 19 ) and percentage of patients with eas ( 5 vs. 17 ) was more after year 2000 . \\n the percentage of patients with pituitary macroadenoma among cd patients was higher ( 20% vs. 12% ) during the earlier period . \\n etiology of cushing 's syndrome : comparison with some published series common co - morbidities with cs are obesity , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , osteoporosis , infections and neurocognitive dysfunction . \\n those with weight loss were patients with a very long duration of symptoms , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and infections like tuberculosis . \\n we did not observe significant difference in the clinical profile of patients with different etiology for cortisol excess except that obesity was less common among the eas and adrenal carcinoma group and psychiatric problems were more common among eas compared with the other groups . \\n acth independent cs is mostly due to unilateral adrenal tumors ; adenomas are more common than carcinomas . in this present study , \\n it is difficult to say whether adrenal carcinoma is more common among indian patients or if this is a reflection of referral bias . \\n cyclicity / periodic hormonogenesis have been reported , although rarely , in patients with cs . \\n some of the hypotheses suggested to explain this phenomenon are episodic hemorrhage , synchronous growth and death of tumor cells , fluctuations in the hypothalamus  pituitary  adrenal axis , etc . \\n , cyclicity has been defined as occurrence of three peaks and two troughs of hypercortisolemia . \\n skeletal fractures , avascular necrosis of bones , venous thrombosis , and cardiac dysfunction are well documented in patients with cs . \\n one of our patients had extensive ivc thrombosis with miliary shadows in the lungs that was mistaken for milliary tuberculosis . \\n three patients had breast carcinoma ( one at the time of diagnosis and two during follow - up ) and two had accoustic neuroma . \\n it is not possible to say whether there is a causal link or whether it is a coincidence , as these are not uncommon diseases . \\n the strength of this study is the large number of patients studied at a single center by the same investigators and the long -

The disease is associated with iron overload, resulting in liver cirrhosis/cancer, cardiomegaly, kidney dysfunction, diabetes, and arthritis. Fe2+-induced oxidative damage is suspected in the etiology of these symptoms. Here we examined, using Hfe-/- mice, whether disruption of uric acid (UA) homeostasis plays any role in HH-associated arthritis. We detected elevated levels of UA in serum and intestine in Hfe-/- mice compared with controls. Though the expression of xanthine oxidase, which generates UA, was not different in liver and intestine between wild type and Hfe-/- mice, the enzymatic activity was higher in Hfe-/- mice. We then examined various transporters involved in UA absorption/excretion. Glut9 expression did not change; however, there was an increase in Mrp4 and a decrease in Abcg2 in Hfe-/- mice. As ABCG2 mediates intestinal excretion of UA and mutations in ABCG2 cause hyperuricemia, we examined the potential connection between iron and ABCG2.

HISS release decreases with age, and exercise causes metabolic improvements in aging, therefore it is important to analyze the effect of exercise on age-associated decline in HISS-action. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that improved insulin sensitivity, by voluntary running-wheel exercise in aging rats, is attained by preserving the HISS response. We also investigate the possible association of exercise-mediated beneficial changes in metabolic conditions and body composition with improved HISS-action.

Although it is known that leptin resistance can lead to attenuated insulin signaling, whether insulin resistance can lead to or exacerbate leptin resistance is unknown. To investigate the molecular events underlying crosstalk between these signaling pathways, immortalized hypothalamic neuronal models, rHypoE-19 and mHypoA-2/10, were utilized. Prolonged insulin exposure was used to induce cellular insulin resistance, and thereafter leptin-mediated regulation of signal transduction and gene expression was assessed. Leptin directly repressed agouti-related peptide (AgRP) mRNA levels, but induced urocortin-2 (UCN2), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), IRS2, and IR transcription, through leptin-mediated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation. Neuronal insulin resistance, as assessed by attenuated Akt phosphorylation, blocked leptin-mediated signal transduction, and AgRP, UCN2, IRS1, IRS2 and IR synthesis. Insulin resistance caused a substantial decrease in IR protein levels, forkhead box protein 1 (FoxO1) phosphorylation, and an increase in suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) protein levels. Cellular insulin resistance may cause or exacerbate neuronal leptin resistance, and by extension, obesity. It is essential to unravel the effects of neuronal insulin resistance given that both peripheral, as well as the less widely studied central insulin resistance, may contribute to the development of metabolic, reproductive and cardiovascular disorders.

Interestingly, insulin treatment of αXBPKD cells reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (pY(896)), and phosphorylation of Akt, while enhancing serine phosphorylation (pS(307)) of IRS-1.

We previously found that the Akt/PKB ortholog AKT-1 dampens the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress in the germline by negatively regulating the p53-like transcription factor CEP-1. Here, we report unexpected rearrangements to the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, whereby the insulin-like receptor DAF-2 and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK-1 oppose AKT-1 to promote DNA damage-induced apoptosis. While DNA damage does not affect phosphorylation at the PDK-1 site Thr350/Thr308 of AKT-1, it increased phosphorylation at Ser517/Ser473. Although ablation of daf-2 or pdk-1 completely suppressed akt-1-dependent apoptosis, the transcriptional activation of CEP-1 was unaffected, suggesting that daf-2 and pdk-1 act independently or downstream of cep-1 and akt-1. Ablation of the akt-1 paralog akt-2 or the downstream target of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway daf-16 (a FOXO transcription factor) restored sensitivity to damage-induced apoptosis in daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants. In addition, daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants have reduced levels of phospho-MPK-1/ERK in their germ cells, indicating that the insulin/IGF-1 pathway promotes Ras signaling in the germline. Ablation of the Ras effector gla-3, a negative regulator of mpk-1, restored sensitivity to apoptosis in daf-2 mutants, suggesting that gla-3 acts downstream of daf-2. In addition, the hypersensitivity of let-60/Ras gain-of-function mutants to damage-induced apoptosis was suppressed to wild-type levels by ablation of daf-2.
