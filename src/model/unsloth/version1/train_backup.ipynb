Context: Polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN) affects up to 10% of kidney transplant recipients and is a major risk factor for graft loss. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an important recognition molecule of the innate immune system, and its deficiency has been associated with susceptibility to various infections. In transplantation, on the other hand, high MBL levels have been associated with increased tissue damage in ischemia-reperfusion models and poorer graft and patient survival in solid organ transplant patients. To investigate the relation between MBL and BK virus infection, post-transplant (post-Tx) MBL levels were determined in a cohort of de novo kidney transplant patients with and without BK viremia. 41 de novo kidney transplant patients with high (n=16, group 1) or low level BK viremia (n=25, group 2) and 64 patients without BK viremia (group 3) were included. In every patient, functional MBL levels were determined at 1-3 time points (days 30, 90 or 180) post-Tx using an MBL oligomer ELISA.

house developed computer program ( viisoftware , lexington ) running on a pentium iv based computer . \\n heart rate ( hr ) was computed from the pulsatile bp signal . for data analysis the 24-hour day was divided into six 4-hour periods starting from 12  :  00 midnight ( p0 , p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , and p5 ) . the blood pressure and heart rate were plotted to reveal any diurnal variations and cyclic variations . \\n two -

group difference in absolute weight , both groups exhibited similar growth patterns during the study period . \\n likewise , we reported   that baseline mean arterial pressure ( map ) did not differ between groups and that hr was minimally , but significantly , lower in the diabetic animals versus the controls for the first 6 months after the bbdp became diabetic . \\n one diabetic rat died about day 120 of diabetic duration and another at day 244 . \\n figure 1 shows ten days of mean arterial pressure ( map ) , hr , and light / dark cycles for a diabetes - resistant animal . \\n the circadian variations in blood pressure and heart rate are demonstrably out of phase with the light / dark rhythm ( i.e. , lowest map and hr during light on ) , as would be expected for an animal that is most active during the dark . \\n panels a , b , and c of figure 2 graph map recorded for the time periods p0 ( 12 midnight4  am ) , p1 ( 4  am8  am ) , p2 ( 8  am12 noon ) , p3 ( 124  pm ) , p4 ( 4  pm8  pm ) , and p5 ( 8  pm12 midnight ) in the bbdp rats at the indicated days following their becoming diabetic . \\n each point is an across - rats average , in turn derived from a beat - by - beat average over the four - hour recordings for each time period for each subject . \\n the results show that prior to conversion ( top - left panel ) to the diabetic state ( i.e. , control , dark blue ) blood pressure was high at p0 , was lower at p1 , and rose to a peak at p2 and then fell again at p3 . \\n a similar circadian pattern was recorded for the onset of diabetes at day 0 ( panel a , maroon ) and again at day 21 ( yellow ) . by day 60 ( light blue ) \\n the peak diurnal blood pressure was shifted to period p3 ( 124  pm ) while the night time peak increased ( p5 ; 97.4  5.2  mmhg ) . \\n the circadian bp rhythms for diabetic duration 35 months are shown in figure 2(b ) ( top - right panel ) . \\n the diurnal peak of bp remained at p3 at 90 days ( maroon ) and 120 days ( yellow ) while the nighttime peak was still at p5 . at 150 days ( light blue ) peak diurnal \\n bp was at p2 ; however bp at p4 fell below the early morning dip at p1 . \\n the pattern of circadian changes in bp appeared to normalize later in diabetes , but the amplitudes of the changes are greatly reduced especially in the p3 to p4 period ( figure 2(c ) ) . \\n the diabetes - resistant rats bbdr showed no appreciable shifts in the diurnal peak period over the study period . \\n circadian changes in heart rate ( figure 3 ) followed a pattern similar to that of mean arterial pressure . prior to conversion and at day 0 heart rate was high at p0 followed by a dip at p1 and increasing to a peak at p2 ( figure 3(a ) , top - left ) . \\n however from day 21 to day 90 the peak shifted to midafternoon at p3 . beyond day 150 \\n there was a return to normal pattern with a dip at p1 and peak at p2 , another dip at p3 , and gradual rise to p4 and p5 in the night ( figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) ) . \\n the cross - correlation coefficient of heart rate and blood pressure   in the diabetic animals in the six time periods looks  parabolic  with p0 and p5 having the highest values ( p0 : 0.65  0.031 ; p5 : 0.68  0.019 ) , while the periods p3 and p4 had the lowest values ( 0.49  0.036 , 0.50  0.04 , resp . ) in the control recording ( figure 4(a ) ) . \\n the cross - correlation coefficient was elevated relative to control at p1 and p2 at the onset of diabetes ( i.e. , day 0 , maroon ) . by days 21 and 60 \\n there was a midday peak at p2 with dips at p1 and p3 showing a change in pattern . \\n the late diurnal coefficient showed little or no change from p3 to p5 at diabetic age 120150 days ( figure 4(b ) ) . with an increase in diabetic age the amplitude of the variation in cross - correlation coefficient across the 24-hour day \\n was reduced by day 244 , but overall values remained high . however , by the 9th month the cross - correlation coefficient fell significantly with a peak at p2 and lowest dip at p5 ( 0.39  0.06 ) ( figure 4(c ) ) suggesting impairment or degeneration of integrative functions . \\n in contrast the nondiabetic control rats maintained a higher cross - correlation coefficient and did not manifest a dip at p5 ( bbdr : 0.65  0.03 , p < .05 versus bbdp , 0.39  0.06 ) .  \\n figure 5 shows the effect of diabetic age on the circadian cross - correlation coefficient in the diabetic rats . \\n note that , in the pre - conversion period ( i.e. , n14 to n1 ) , there was considerable daily fluctuation in the cross - correlation coefficient ( 0.46 to 0.69 ) . \\n after conversion the range of the daily fluctuation narrowed , and by day 21 all the periods had converged ( 0.6 to 0.67 ) ; thereafter ( day 60 to day166 ) the cross - correlation coefficient again showed a wide circadian fluctuation which was sometimes higher than the pre - conversion values . around day 244 \\n this reduction was steady and continued as the cross - correlation coefficient started to decline by day 273 . \\n the graph shows that apart from the daily rhythm , there is also a long - term periodic cycle of about one - month duration exhibited by this parameter . \\n this fairly regular pattern was diminished later ( from day 180 ) in the diabetes . \\n the lead / lag times of the cross - correlation between hr and bp in the circadian period of the diabetic rats are shown in figure 6 . \\n the negative values of the lead / lag plot indicate that heart rate changes led blood pressure changes by the indicated value ( in sec . ) . in the pre conversion period \\n the values for the night and early morning periods ( p0 , p1 , p4 , and p5 ) were generally higher ( 2.0 to 2.3 sec ) while those for midday ( p2 and p3 ) were lower ( 1.6 to 2.0 sec ) . \\n however about day 21 in the postconversion period there was a change in the trend with the continued reduction of the nighttime lead values , especially between day 21 and day 90 . \\n there was gradual reduction in the lead / lag time for the various periods as the diabetes progressed ; however , by day 244 the diurnal circadian variation was significant with p0 ( nighttime ) having the highest lead ( 2.0  0.06 sec ) while p3 ( afternoon ) had the lowest ( 1.45  0.07 sec ) . \\n when the changes were aggregated ( figures 7(a ) and 7(b ) ) the average cross - correlation coefficients of the peak ( figure 7(a ) ) and nadir ( figure 7(b ) ) showed less fluctuation in the control diabetic - resistant rats suggesting that the between group differences are not primarily due to maturation . \\n results from this study in an animal model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes mellitus are associated with changes in resting circadian cardiovascular and autonomic functions . \\n it is also established that central suprachiasmatic nucleus and related structures act as circadian pacemakers for the whole body [ 24 , 25 ] . \\n the interplay of the central and peripheral oscillators enables the organism to adjust the activities of its organs to maximize efficiency while functioning optimally in a changing environment . \\n our results show that at the onset of diabetes up to the 3rd diabetic week blood pressure had two peaks at midnight / morning , and midafternoon , interlaced with a dip in the morning and followed by another dip late afternoon . \\n in this longitudinal study a phase shift was seen by the 2nd diabetic month in which the diurnal blood pressure peak shifted from midafternoon to late afternoon ( p3 ) . \\n this new pattern was sustained to the third and fourth months of the duration of diabetes . \\n the prediabetic pattern of blood pressure changes was displayed beyond the fifth month , but the amplitude of the rhythm was reduced . \\n the cross - correlation coefficient of heart rate and blood pressure showed wide circadian variation in the pre - conversion period , and the amplitude of the rhythm reduced in the postconversion period and showed little or no fluctuation in the late afternoon - night section during the third to the fifth diabetic month . a sharp fall in the cross - correlation coefficient followed in the 9 - 10th month with reduction of the diurnal range . \\n our results suggest that there is also a seasonal rhythm of oscillation in cross - correlation coefficient with a periodicity of about sixty days . \\n the lead time of the peak lead / lag plot of the cross - correlation coefficient was negative throughout the study showing that heart rate change was leading blood pressure change . \\n this value diminished with diabetic age but did not overturn , suggesting that sympathetic efferent control of the cardiovascular system was maintained , but with reduction in effectiveness . \\n the diurnal rhythm showed that the heart rate lead over blood pressure was longer in the morning period ( p1 ) before and at onset of diabetes . \\n the combination of the spontaneously diabetic rat model and telemetry has proven advantageous for this long - term longitudinal study of the circadian cardiovascular and autonomic function in diabetes . \\n our findings are consonant with earlier reports of time - dependent alterations in heart rate , circadian variation , pulse pressure , and cardiac autonomic control in streptozotocin- ( stz- ) treated rats [ 18 , 26 , 27 ] . \\n young et al .   have also reported alteration of internal circadian clock in the heart of stz - treated rats . \\n the former were acute studies or intermittent - duration studies lasting one day , 8 weeks , and ten weeks , respectively , and some used indwelling arterial cannula for blood pressure measurement . \\n to the best of our knowledge the present study is unique because we not only measured continuous prediabetic data , but we also recorded during the diabetic conversion period and , thereafter , continuous , long - term cardiovascular function . \\n our observations reveal that there is yet another rhythmic long - term variation of cardiovascular function . \\n this rhythm has a periodicity of about sixty days which is not obvious in diabetes - resistant rats . \\n the mechanisms underlying the reported changes in cardiovascular function were thought to be in the heart and/or neuroendocrine control . \\n it has been recognized that stz - induced alterations of the circadian clock of the heart may be independent of diabetes development . \\n our results do not show a dramatic change in heart rate at onset of diabetes . \\n this is in contrast with the severe bradycardia of about 20%   and 30%   in earlier reports that used stz . \\n other reports on isolated cardiac preparations have associated stz diabetes with depression of basal spontaneous pacemaker rate [ 2931 ] , which was not affected by nadolol or atropine [ 31 , 32 ] . \\n it was thought that changes in electrophysiological properties of the sinoatrial ( sa ) node of the heart , such as maximum diastolic potential , threshold , or slope of diastolic depolarization , were responsible . \\n this may be due to central effect(s ) on cardiovascular system via the autonomic nervous system . \\n we have applied computational cross - correlation coefficient analysis of the changes in heart rate and blood pressure to the circadian rhythm and the long - term variability of heart rate and blood pressure in these animals . \\n this method has been shown to be advantageous for investigating dynamic arterial blood pressure and heart rate control [ 21 , 33 ] . \\n this method revealed different changes in circadian rhythms at different times in the development of diabetes . in the control period the circadian rhythm consisted of a unipodal curve with a peak in the night and a dip in the midday . \\n immediately at conversion to diabetes the circadian rhythm showed a sustained peak of the cross - correlation coefficient into the mornings . \\n however by the second month the relationship changed to a bipodal curve with peaks in the night and midday and dips in the morning and afternoon . \\n the cross - correlation coefficient remained positive indicating   that sympathetic control was maintained , though with fluctuations . \\n thus it can be surmised that in this period permanent damage to autonomic regulatory mechanisms may not have occurred , but some destabilization of the resting tone may be in place . in the ninth month we observed a significant reduction in cross - correlation coefficient and a phase shift in the peaks and dips with the nighttime having the lowest dip , and this did not occur in the diabetes - resistant rats . \\n this may mark the beginning of irreversible impairment of autonomic and cardiovascular function . in classic blood pressure driven changes as in baroreflex tests , haemorrhage and postural change , \\n bp change is followed reflexly by a compensatory change in hr yielding a negative cross - correlation with bp leading hr . while this is true for volume expansion , compartment reduction via vasoconstriction or vasodilation , this appears not to hold true for euvolemic and nonbaroreflex adjustments . in conclusion , \\n our observations show that in the development of diabetes the circadian cardiovascular rhythms show slight alterations , though these changes only became significant at the late stage of the disease . \\n this is consistent with impairment of integration and/or functional autonomic capacity in prolonged diabetes mellitus .', 'output': 'circadian changes in cardiovascular function during the progression of diabetes mellitus in the diabetes prone rat ( bbdp ) ( n = 8) were studied . \\n age - matched diabetes - resistant rats ( bbdr ) served as controls . \\n bp was recorded via telemetry in contiguous 4  hr time periods over 24 hours starting with 12 midnight to 4  am as period zero ( p0 ) . \\n prior to onset of diabetes bp was high at p0 , peaked at p2 , and then fell again at p3 ; bp and heart rate ( hr ) then increased gradually at p4 and leveled off at p5 , thereby exhibiting a bipodal rhythm . \\n these patterns changed during long - term diabetes . \\n the cross - correlation coefficient of bp and hr was not significantly different across groups at onset , but it fell significantly at 9 months of duration of diabetes ( bbdp : 0.39  0.06 ; bbdr : 0.65  0.03 ; p < .05 ) . \\n these results show that changes in circadian cardiovascular rhythms in diabetes mellitus became significant at the late stage of the disease .', '__index_level_0__': 30519}\n",

related \\n complications . \\n pd is a chronic bacterial infection that affects both the gingiva and the bone that \\n supports the teeth and is caused by anaerobic gram - negative microorganisms that are \\n present in the bacterial plaque that adheres to the teeth . \\n pd is a very prevalent condition . in the united states , over half the population aged \\n 18 years or more have pd in its early stages , increasing to up to 75% after the age \\n of 35 years ; its mild to moderate forms are present in 30% to 50% , and \\n pd has even higher prevalence in \\n minorities , in poor and developing countries and a considerable global \\n variation . \\n the presence of anaerobic gram - negative bacteria causes a local inflammatory response \\n that becomes chronic and progressive ; this inflammation of the gingiva causes \\n alveolar bone destruction and loss of the tissue attachment to the teeth , caused by \\n components of microbial plaque that have the capacity to induce an initial infiltrate \\n of inflammatory cells , such as lymphocytes , macrophages , and polymorphonuclear \\n leukocytes ( pmns ) . \\n some microbial components , especially lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) , activate macrophages \\n that synthesize and secrete a great variety and amount of pro - inflammatory molecules , \\n such as the cytokines interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- ) ; \\n prostaglandins , especially prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) ; and some other enzymes . \\n bacterial toxins can also activate t lymphocytes to produce il-1 and lymphotoxin \\n ( lt ) , a molecule with properties that are similar to those of tnf-. these cytokines \\n show potent pro - inflammatory and catabolic activities , and have important roles in \\n periodontal tissue destruction caused by collagenolytic enzymes such as \\n metalloproteinases ( mmps ) . \\n these \\n collagenolytic enzymes are activated by reactive oxygen species and elevate the \\n levels of interstitial collagenase in inflamed gingival tissue . \\n the attachment loss deepens the sulcus , creating a periodontal pocket that contains \\n thousands of millions of bacterial cells . \\n this stage is the transition between \\n gingivitis and periodontitis , the most common pds . \\n when bacterial biofilms on the teeth are not disrupted on a regular basis , the \\n emergences of gram - negative anaerobic bacterial species activate several host \\n processes that will interfere in the extent and severity of the disease . \\n recently , many advances have occurred in the knowledge of the nature of the \\n infectious agents involved in pd . \\n approximately 500 different bacterial entities and \\n various human viruses have already been associated with the formation of dental \\n microbial plaque . \\n the most frequently recognized periodontal pathogens belong to three microaerophilic \\n species ( actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , campylobacter rectus , \\n and eikenella corrodens ) and seven anaerobic species \\n ( porphyromonas gingivalis , bacteroides forsythus , treponema denticola , \\n prevotella intermedia , fusobacterium nucleatum , eubacterium , and \\n spirochetes ) . \\n various herpes viruses , such as the human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) and epstein - barr \\n virus ( ebv-1 ) , have recently also emerged as pathogens in cases of destructive \\n pd . \\n many conditions can predispose and/or facilitate the occurrence of pd such as \\n smoking , genetic influences , estrogen \\n deficiency , estrogen \\n excess , \\n dyslipidemia and obesity . \\n this epidemic is also associated with an increased occurrence \\n of obesity - related diseases like hypertension , cardiovascular disease , metabolic \\n syndrome and dm that are also linked to pd . \\n dm encompasses a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous metabolic \\n disorders characterized by hyperglycemia that results from a defective insulin \\n secretion and/or activity . \\n dm is classified according to its etiology as type 1 ( t1d ) , type 2 ( t2d ) , gestational \\n diabetes ( gdm ) and other specific types . \\n t1d results from the destruction of \\n beta - cells within the islets of langerhans of the pancreas , which results in a \\n complete insulin deficiency ; it can be immune - mediated or have an idiopathic \\n etiology . \\n t2d ranges from an insulin resistance which progresses into an insulin \\n deficiency due to a secondary failure in the pancreatic beta - cells . \\n gdm is defined as \\n any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy . \\n lastly , the category \" other specific types \" comprehends a group of several types of \\n dm with different etiologies . \\n developed countries have a higher prevalence of dm than developing countries and more \\n women than men are affected with dm . \\n the \\n prevalence of dm in adults all over the world was estimated to be around 4.0% and it \\n was expected to rise to 5.4% by the year 2025 . numerically it means a rise from 135 \\n million in 1995 to 300 million in the year 2025 . \\n an increase of 42% ( from 51 to 72 million ) is expected \\n in developed countries and an increase of 170% ( from 84 to 228 million ) in the \\n developing world . \\n therefore , it is expected that by the year 2025 , 75% of people with \\n dm will be living in developing countries where the majority of people with dm are \\n aged between 45 - 64 years old . \\n in developed countries , the majority of people with dm \\n are older than 65 years . \\n people with diabetes and with chronically poor metabolic control can experience \\n micro - vascular and macro - vascular complications leading to a significant burden for \\n the individual and for the society . \\n this burden includes direct costs of medical care \\n and indirect costs , such as loss of productivity , which result from diabetes - related \\n morbidity and premature mortality . health care expenses for people with diabetes is more than two - times higher than the \\n expenses for people without diabetes ; the direct and indirect expenditures \\n attributable to diabetes in 2007 in the usa were estimated at us$174 billion , with \\n slightly more spent on chronic complications attributable to dm than properly on dm \\n care . \\n the international \\n diabetes federation estimated that dm costs account for 5 - 10% of the total healthcare \\n budget in many countries . in brazil , \\n the per capita total , direct medical , direct nonmedical \\n and indirect costs of patients with t1d were us$ 1,741.42 , us$ 1,319.15 , us$ 61.47 \\n and us$ 360.81 , respectively . \\n the total direct non - medical costs were us$ 195,461.54 , \\n spent with transportation for the patients and caregivers . \\n total annual costs for care of outpatients with t2d \\n were us$ 2,108 per patient , out of which us$ 1,335 per \\n patient of direct costs ( 63.3% ) and us$ 773 per patient of \\n indirect costs ( 36.7% ) . \\n patients with both micro - vascular and macro - vascular \\n complications had higher costs ( us$ 3,199 per patient ) compared to \\n those with either micro - vascular ( us$ 2,062 per patient ) or \\n macro - vascular ( us$ 2,517 per patient ) complications only . \\n the \\n greatest amount of direct costs was attributed to medication ( 48.2% ) . the search conducted for \\n this review used the bbo ( bibliografia brasileira de \\n odontologia ) , medline , lilacs and pubmed for controlled trials databases , in english \\n and portuguese languages published from 1960 to october 2012 . \\n primary research \\n reports on investigations of relationships between dm / dm control , pd / periodontal \\n treatment and pd / dm / diabetes - related complications identified relevant papers and \\n meta - analyses published in this period . \\n the identified reports are displayed in figures organized \\n according to the following groups : 1- the effects of dm on pd ; 2- the effects of \\n glycemic control on pd and 3-the effects of pd on glycemic control and on \\n diabetes - related complications . \\n the studies listed in figure 1 compared \\n periodontal status in individuals with and without dm in the majority of the reports . \\n these studies were classified according to the study design , type of diabetes , sample \\n number , age range , evaluation of pd and other diabetes - related variables . \\n the \\n majority of the studies were cross - sectional ( 21/29 ) and limited in the possibility \\n of providing a causal - effect relationship . \\n effects of diabetes mellitus on periodontal disease pd= periodontal disease - dm = diabetes mellitus - t1d = diabetes mellitus type \\n 1 - t2d = diabetes mellitus type 2 - gdm = gestational diabetes mellitus the link between dm and the adverse effects on pd has been extensively \\n described . \\n we have found that 27 in 29 studies showed \\n supportive evidence of the adverse impact of dm on periodontal health . \\n there were four studies of t1d ; one study reported more extensive radiographic bone \\n loss in patients with t1d compared to the controls , lalla , et al . \\n ( 2006 ) in a case - control study found that periodontal \\n destruction can start very early in life in patients with t1d and becomes more \\n prominent as children become adolescents . in a population aged 4 to 33 years , \\n ( 1982 ) reported a \\n significantly higher prevalence of pd in t1d than in non - diabetic siblings and \\n non - diabetic unrelated controls . \\n the prevalence of pd among 11- to 18-year - old \\n teenagers with dm was 9.8% as compared to 1.7% in controls without dm . \\n an accelerated \\n periodontal destruction was found in children and teens with dm , with poor metabolic \\n control . in an adult \\n population aged 40 - 69 years \\n , 58.4% of patients with long standing t1d exhibited \\n severe pd as opposed to 7.1% of controls without dm . \\n two \\n reports were comprised of patients aged 15 years or older , and \\n twelve included only adults . \\n twelve of these fourteen \\n studies reported significantly poorer periodontal health in subjects with t2d , \\n whereas a significantly poorer greater prevalence was found in one study and no significant difference was \\n found in another study . \\n six reports consist of analyses in which subjects with t1d and t2d were analyzed \\n together without distinction of diabetes type . four studies included children and \\n adolescents and another \\n five of these six studies reported greater \\n prevalence , extent , or severity of pd in subjects with dm . \\n one report did not \\n find significant differences in pd between subjects with and without dm when an \\n adequate metabolic control was found in the former group . regarding gdm , \\n one was conducted only with women with gdm \\n that were compared to a control group between the 34 - 36 gestation weeks . \\n the results of the study suggest that gingivitis seems to be more prevalent in women \\n with gdm compared to healthy pregnant women and the plaque accumulation seems to be \\n the main cause of gingival inflammation . \\n another study found that all types of dm increase the risk of \\n pd , including gdm . \\n two other \\n studies conducted in the usa collected data from over 4,000 women with a history of \\n gdm . \\n one report included ages 15 - 44 and the other , ages 20 - 59 . both reports concluded there is a strong relationship \\n between gdm and pd . \\n pd was found in 45% of pregnant women with gdm \\n vs. 13% in the healthy pregnant women , with an adjusted odds \\n ratio of 9.11 . in non - pregnant women , 40% of women with t1d or t2d , 25% of those with \\n a history of gdm , and 14% of healthy women had pd . the odds ratio for those with t1d \\n and t2d was 2.76 . \\n ( 2006 ) found the \\n prevalence of pd to be higher in women with a history of gdm and concluded that these \\n women may be at greater risk for developing more severe pd , than women without a \\n history of gdm . \\n finally , taylor \\n ( 2001 ) and mealey ( 2006 ) in two \\n extensive literature reviews found a bidirectional interrelationship between all \\n types of dm , including gdm and pd . \\n two of these studies included subjects with t1d exclusively , seven studies subjects \\n with t2d exclusively and five a combination of subjects with either t1d , t2d , gdm and \\n others ( figure 2 ) . \\n one prospective study \\n conducted with t1d did not show any association between the degree of glycemic \\n control and pd but a positive association with local oral hygiene measures , and another study , that was \\n cross - sectional , has regarded this association . \\n five of the seven reports published regarding the \\n association between glycemic control and pd in t2d have found this \\n association and two did not . \\n we have found five studies providing \\n information on the differences in periodontal health in groups of mixed types of \\n diabetes ; three have found this association and two did not . among these fourteen studies , \\n eleven were cross - sectional that \\n imposes some limitations on the cause - effect inference ; two were prospective and one \\n was an extensive literature review . \\n otherwise , nine of these reports support the \\n evidence of greater prevalence , extent and severity of pd and also provide evidence \\n that glycemic control worsens in parallel with the worsening of pd . \\n effects of glycemic control on periodontal disease ( gdm= gestational diabetes \\n mellitus ) substantial evidence has been demonstrating dm as a risk factor for the impairment of \\n periodontal health and a growing body of evidence has been supporting pd as having an \\n adverse effect on glycemic control and on the pathophysiology of diabetes - related \\n complications . \\n the inflamed periodontal tissue may serve as a chronic source of \\n bacteria , bacterial products and many inflammatory mediators such as tnf- , il6 , and \\n il1 that have been shown to have important effects on lipid and glucose \\n metabolism and have also been reported to be \\n insulin antagonists and related to insulin resistance that is predominantly found in \\n t2d and gdm . \\n as shown in figure 3 , data interpretation is \\n often confounded by varying definitions of dm and pd and different clinical criteria \\n applied to determine the prevalence , extent , severity of pd , levels of glycemic \\n control and diabetes - related complications ; there is also marked heterogeneity in the \\n studies \\' designs , conduct , length of follow - up , types of participants , and \\n periodontal treatment protocols . \\n effects of periodontal disease on glycemic control and diabetes - related \\n complications abbreviations : rct , randomized controlled trial ; non - rct , non - randomized \\n controlled trial - treatment study ; d , days ; wk , weeks ; m , months ; y , years ; \\n hba1 c , glycated hemoglobin - pd= periodontal disease - dm = diabetes mellitus \\n - t1 d = diabetes mellitus type 1 - t2d = diabetes mellitus type 2 - \\n gdm = gestational diabetes mellitus evidence regarding the effects of pd on glycemic control comes from observational and \\n treatment studies ( figure 3 ) . \\n the treatment \\n studies are a set of reports that include ten randomized clinical trials ( rcts ) , \\n twelve non - rcts , four meta - analyses , one literature review , one longitudinal study , \\n one transversal study , one retrospective study , one prospective study and two \\n clinical cases discussions . the rcts used control groups that were either treated controls , non - treated controls \\n or controls that did not change their usual dental care . \\n among the ten rcts , eight \\n reported a beneficial effect for periodontal therapy and two did not . \\n one of the rcts , recently conducted , \\n showed significant improvement in hba1c levels but did not result in a statistically \\n significant improvement in serum levels of inflammatory markers such as hs - crp , \\n d-8-iso , mmp-2 and mmp-9 . \\n an important source of variation in the rcts is the use of antibiotics with the \\n non - surgical periodontal therapy . \\n this fact brings a lot of confusion in the \\n interpretation of the results of these trials in such a way , that to date , there is \\n no clear evidence to support a requirement for the use of antibiotics in combination \\n with non - surgical periodontal treatment in order to observe an improvement in \\n glycemic control associated with periodontal therapy . among the group of twenty - three periodontal treatment studies that were not rcts , \\n like the rcts , there was marked variation in the \\n use of adjunctive antibiotics , with six of the eight studies that used systemic \\n antibiotics reporting a beneficial effect on glycemic control . \\n additional evidence to support the effect of severe periodontitis on increased risk \\n for poorer glycemic control comes from two longitudinal observational studies . \\n a \\n longitudinal epidemiological study of the pima indians in arizona , usa , which present \\n the world \\'s highest reported prevalence of dm , found that subjects with t2d in good to moderate control and \\n with severe periodontitis at baseline were approximately six times more likely to \\n have poor glycemic control at a 2-year follow - up than those without severe \\n periodontitis at baseline . \\n ( 1998 ) in another \\n observational study of 25 adults with t2d , aged 58 - 77 years , also reported an \\n association between advanced periodontal disease and impaired metabolic \\n control . \\n recently , some important trials have recognized that poor glycemic control is a major \\n determinant for the development of the chronic complications of dm . \\n the diabetes \\n control and complications trial , the epidemiology of diabetes interventions and \\n complications ( edic ) trial , the long - term follow - up study of the dcct , both conducted \\n with t1d and the united kingdom prospective diabetes study ( ukpds ) conducted with \\n t2d , demonstrated that attaining and maintaining good glycemic control could reduce \\n the risk for and/or postpone the progression of micro - vascular complications in \\n patients with t1d and t2d . \\n initially , the ukpds observed a statistically non significant 16% reduction ( p=0.052 ) \\n in the risk of combined fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden death . \\n recently , it was observed that a long - standing good metabolic control can bring \\n significant long - term consequences including the reduction in the risks of fatal or \\n nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden death . \\n the epidemiological analysis from \\n the ukpds showed a continuous association between the risk of cardiovascular \\n complications and glycemic control ; every percentage point decrease in hba1c , was \\n associated with a 25% reduction in diabetes - related deaths , 7% reduction in all - cause \\n mortality , and a 18% reduction in combined fatal and nonfatal myocardial \\n infarction . \\n some observational studies regarding the association between pd and the risk for dm \\n complications have given strong evidence for this association . in a study conducted \\n in sweden , with 39 case - control pairs of individuals with t1d and t2d for a median \\n follow - up time of six years , thorstensson , et al . \\n ( 1996 ) observed a significantly higher prevalence \\n of proteinuria and cardiovascular complications such as stroke , transient ischemic \\n attacks , angina , myocardial infarction and intermittent claudication in the case \\n group than in controls . \\n these findings suggest that an association between renal \\n disease , cardiovascular disease and its complications and severe periodontitis seems \\n to exist . \\n ( 2005 ) , studied \\n the contribution of pd to the mortality associated with t2d in the gila river indian \\n community in arizona , usa , on behalf of the national institute of diabetes and \\n digestive and kidney diseases , addressing nephropathy and cardiovascular disease . \\n this was a prospective longitudinal study with a cohort of 628 individuals , aged \\n approximately 35 years old , for a median follow - up of eleven years ( range 0.3 to 16 ) . \\n during the study period 204 subjects died . \\n individuals with severe pd had 3.2 times \\n greater risk for cardio - renal mortality ( i.e. , ischemic heart disease and diabetic \\n nephropathy combined ) compared with the reference group ( no , mild , or moderate pd \\n combined ) , after adjustment for several major risk factors of cardio - renal mortality \\n such as age , sex , diabetes duration , hba1c , body mass index ( bmi ) , hypertension , \\n blood glucose , cholesterol , electrocardiographic abnormalities , macro - albuminuria , \\n and smoking . \\n ( 2007 ) , in the same community investigated the effect of \\n periodontitis on overt nephropathy and end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) in a group of \\n 529 subjects with t2d , aged approximately 25 years old . after adjusting for age , sex , \\n diabetes duration , bmi , and smoking \\n , they found that periodontitis and edentulism \\n were significantly associated with the risk of overt nephropathy and esrd . \\n the \\n incidence of macro - albuminuria was 2.0 , 2.1 , and 2.6 times greater in individuals \\n with moderate or severe periodontitis or in those who were edentulous , respectively , \\n than those with none / mild periodontitis . \\n the incidence of esrd was also 2.3 , 3.5 , and \\n 4.9 times greater for individuals with moderate or severe periodontitis or for those \\n who were edentulous , respectively , than those with none / mild periodontitis . \\n the clinical and epidemiological evidence found in the literature we reviewed \\n provides support for the concept that dm can have adverse effects on pd , that pd \\n worsens in parallel with glycemic control and finally that pd is associated with an \\n increase in the risk for diabetes - related complications . \\n however , further \\n prospective , rigorous , controlled trials with a larger number of patients , in \\n ethnically diverse populations are warranted to establish these relationships and \\n that treating pd can positively influence glycemic control and possibly reduce the \\n burden of diabetes - related complications . \\n pd is a chronic bacterial infection that affects both the gingiva and the bone that \\n supports the teeth and is caused by anaerobic gram - negative microorganisms that are \\n present in the bacterial plaque that adheres to the teeth . \\n pd is a very prevalent condition . in the united states , over half the population aged \\n 18 years or more \\n have pd in its early stages , increasing to up to 75% after the age \\n of 35 years ; its mild to moderate forms are present in 30% to 50% , and the severe \\n generalized form in 5% to 15% of the general adult population . \\n pd has even higher prevalence in \\n minorities , in poor and developing countries and a considerable global \\n variation . \\n the presence of anaerobic gram -

44 and the other , ages 20 - 59 . \\n pd was found in 45% of pregnant women with gdm \\n vs. 13% in the healthy pregnant women , with an adjusted odds \\n ratio of 9.11 . in non - pregnant women , \\n 40% of women with t1d or t2d , 25% of those with \\n a history of gdm , and 14% of healthy women had pd . \\n ( 2006 ) found the \\n prevalence of pd to be higher in women with a history of gdm and concluded that these \\n women may be at greater risk for developing more severe pd , than women without a \\n history of gdm . \\n finally , taylor \\n ( 2001 ) and mealey ( 2006 ) in two \\n extensive literature reviews found a bidirectional interrelationship between all \\n types of dm , including gdm and pd . \\n two of these studies included subjects with t1d exclusively , seven studies subjects \\n with t2d exclusively and five a combination of subjects with either t1d , t2d , gdm and \\n others ( figure 2 ) . \\n one prospective study \\n conducted with t1d did not show any association between the degree of glycemic \\n control and pd but a positive association with local oral hygiene measures , and another study , that was \\n cross - sectional , has regarded this association . \\n five of the seven reports published regarding the \\n association between glycemic control and pd in t2d have found this \\n association and two did not . \\n we have found five studies providing \\n information on the differences in periodontal health in groups of mixed types of \\n diabetes ; three have found this association and two did not . among these fourteen studies , \\n eleven were cross - sectional that \\n imposes some limitations on the cause - effect inference ; two were prospective and one \\n was an extensive literature review . \\n otherwise , nine of these reports support the \\n evidence of greater prevalence , extent and severity of pd and also provide evidence \\n that glycemic control worsens in parallel with the worsening of pd . \\n substantial evidence has been demonstrating dm as a risk factor for the impairment of \\n periodontal health and a growing body of evidence has been supporting pd as having an \\n adverse effect on glycemic control and on the pathophysiology of diabetes - related \\n complications . \\n the inflamed periodontal tissue may serve as a chronic source of \\n bacteria , bacterial products and many inflammatory mediators such as tnf- , il6 , and \\n il1 that have been shown to have important effects on lipid and glucose \\n metabolism and have also been reported to be \\n insulin antagonists and related to insulin resistance that is predominantly found in \\n t2d and gdm . as shown in figure 3 , data interpretation is \\n often confounded by varying definitions of dm and pd and different clinical criteria \\n applied to determine the prevalence , extent , severity of pd , levels of glycemic \\n control and diabetes - related complications ; there is also marked heterogeneity in the \\n studies \\' designs , conduct , length of follow - up , types of participants , and \\n periodontal treatment protocols . \\n effects of periodontal disease on glycemic control and diabetes -

pd= periodontal disease - dm = diabetes mellitus \\n - t1 d = diabetes mellitus type 1 - t2d = diabetes mellitus type 2 - \\n gdm = gestational diabetes mellitus evidence regarding the effects of pd on glycemic control comes from observational and \\n treatment studies ( figure 3 ) . \\n the treatment \\n studies are a set of reports that include ten randomized clinical trials ( rcts ) , \\n twelve non - rcts , four meta - analyses , one literature review , one longitudinal study , \\n one transversal study , one retrospective study , one prospective study and two \\n clinical cases discussions . the rcts used control groups that were either treated controls , non - treated controls \\n or controls that did not change their usual dental care . \\n among the ten rcts , eight \\n reported a beneficial effect for periodontal therapy and two did not . \\n one of the rcts , recently conducted , \\n showed significant improvement in hba1c levels but did not result in a statistically \\n significant improvement in serum levels of inflammatory markers such as hs - crp , \\n d-8-iso , mmp-2 and mmp-9 . \\n an important source of variation in the rcts is the use of antibiotics with the \\n non - surgical periodontal therapy . \\n this fact brings a lot of confusion in the \\n interpretation of the results of these trials in such a way , that to date , there is \\n no clear evidence to support a requirement for the use of antibiotics in combination \\n with non - surgical periodontal treatment in order to observe an improvement in \\n glycemic control associated with periodontal therapy . among the group of twenty - three periodontal treatment studies that were not rcts , \\n like the rcts , there was marked variation in the \\n use of adjunctive antibiotics , with six of the eight studies that used systemic \\n antibiotics reporting a beneficial effect on glycemic control . \\n additional evidence to support the effect of severe periodontitis on increased risk \\n for poorer glycemic control comes from two longitudinal observational studies . \\n a \\n longitudinal epidemiological study of the pima indians in arizona , usa , which present \\n the world \\'s highest reported prevalence of dm , found that subjects with t2d in good to moderate control and \\n with severe periodontitis at baseline were approximately six times more likely to \\n have poor glycemic control at a 2-year follow - up than those without severe \\n periodontitis at baseline . \\n ( 1998 ) in another \\n observational study of 25 adults with t2d , aged 58 - 77 years , also reported an \\n association between advanced periodontal disease and impaired metabolic \\n control . \\n recently , some important trials have recognized that poor glycemic control is a major \\n determinant for the development of the chronic complications of dm . \\n the diabetes \\n control and complications trial , the epidemiology of diabetes interventions and \\n complications ( edic ) trial , the long - term follow - up study of the dcct , both conducted \\n with t1d and the united kingdom prospective diabetes study ( ukpds ) conducted with \\n t2d , demonstrated that attaining and maintaining good glycemic control could reduce \\n the risk for and/or postpone the progression of micro - vascular complications in \\n patients with t1d and t2d . \\n initially , the ukpds observed a statistically non significant 16% reduction ( p=0.052 ) \\n in the risk of combined fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden death . \\n recently , it was observed that a long - standing good metabolic control can bring \\n significant long - term consequences including the reduction in the risks of fatal or \\n nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden death . \\n the epidemiological analysis from \\n the ukpds showed a continuous association between the risk of cardiovascular \\n complications and glycemic control ; every percentage point decrease in hba1c , was \\n associated with a 25% reduction in diabetes - related deaths , 7% reduction in all - cause \\n mortality , and a 18% reduction in combined fatal and nonfatal myocardial \\n infarction . \\n some observational studies regarding the association between pd and the risk for dm \\n complications have given strong evidence for this association . in a study conducted \\n in sweden , with 39 case - control pairs of individuals with t1d and t2d for a median \\n follow - up time of six years , thorstensson , et al . \\n ( 1996 ) observed a significantly higher prevalence \\n of proteinuria and cardiovascular complications such as stroke , transient ischemic \\n attacks , angina , myocardial infarction and intermittent claudication in the case \\n group than in controls . \\n these findings suggest that an association between renal \\n disease , cardiovascular disease and its complications and severe periodontitis seems \\n to exist . \\n ( 2005 ) , studied \\n the contribution of pd to the mortality associated with t2d in the gila river indian \\n community in arizona , usa , on behalf of the national institute of diabetes and \\n digestive and kidney diseases , addressing nephropathy and cardiovascular disease . \\n this was a prospective longitudinal study with a cohort of 628 individuals , aged \\n approximately 35 years old , for a median follow -

renal mortality \\n such as age , sex , diabetes duration , hba1c , body mass index ( bmi ) , hypertension , \\n blood glucose , cholesterol , electrocardiographic abnormalities , macro - albuminuria , \\n and smoking . \\n ( 2007 ) , in the same community investigated the effect of \\n periodontitis on overt nephropathy and end -

secreting cell autoantigens can be demonstrated [ 13 ] . in this context , biochemically detectable autoantibodies against insulin ( iaa ) , glutamic acid decarboxylase ( gada ) , insulinoma - associated antigen 2 ( ia-2a ) , and zn - transporter 8 ( znt8a ) as well as their counterpart immunofluorescent anti - islet antibodies ( ica ) serve as reliable biomarkers for t1d development . \\n specifically , knip et al .   demonstrated that all children initially testing positive for both gada and ia-2a progressed to clinical t1d over a 26-year followup . over the last few decades the incidence of t1d has dramatically increased in many countries particularly in early childhood , suggesting that an event associated with progression towards t1d disease was occurring early in life . \\n an increasing number of studies have suggested that the composition of the intestinal microbiota might contribute significantly to the development of disorders such as t1d since changes to the microflora mirror changes in general life styles and the social system [ 46 ] . \\n it is believed that intestinal colonization with certain bacteria strongly influences systemic immune responses early in life and may play a significant role in modulating the development of various chronic diseases . \\n some of the most common constituents of the gastrointestinal tract microbiota include bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species that have been shown to play a significant role in the development of immune - mediated disorders in humans [ 811 ] . \\n that is , predominant colonization with b. adolescentis has been reported in patients with allergic disorders compared to colonization patterns observed in individuals with nonallergic disorders [ 1214 ] . \\n other bifidobacterium species have been shown to have diverse effects , including variable associations of b. longum with immune - mediated and inflammatory diseases . \\n studies of rodent disease models [ 15 , 16 ] have also identified differences in the ability of different bifidobacterium species in modulating immune reactivity and inflammation . \\n most well known are the effects of the probiotic strain l. rhamnosus gg in preventing atopic eczema among infants , possibly by modulating the immune response to allergens . \\n the recent identification of the l. rhamnosus gg p40 molecule as an immunomodulator   represents a significant step forward towards resolving problems related to the effects of probiotics in vivo . \\n previously we demonstrated that the elicitation of antibodies against l. acidophilus antigenic components differed between children with various chronic diseases . \\n the current study describes experiments designed to extend these observations by investigating the prevalence of serum antibodies against b. adolescentis , b. longum , and l. rhamnosus gg in young children that developed or did not develop t1d . \\n plasma samples ( n = 107 ) from 38 children participating in the finnish type 1 diabetes prediction and prevention ( dipp ) study and born between 1995 and 2003 were included in this study . \\n children were separated into 2 groups of 19 children ( 11 females ) each matched for age and sex . \\n one group was comprised of children who later developed at least 2 t1d -

containing dairy products by children and adults in finland . \\n we discovered 25 clearly distinguishable l. rhamnosus gg antigenic proteins ranging between 11 and 86  kda ( table 1 ) . \\n the number of l. rhamnosus gg proteins recognized by igg increased steadily with age . \\n children between the ages of 12 and 24 months presented with significantly more antibodies against 5/9 ( 31 , 42 , 45 , 47 , and 49  kda proteins ) selected highly reactive proteins compared to reactivity observed in 3-month - old infants . however , no significant differences in igg reactivity were observed in response to l. rhamnosus gg antigens between ia - positive and ia - negative children . \\n the average number of igg - reactive l. rhamnosus gg protein bands was 10.5  6.6 in ia - positive infants ( between 5 and 17 bands ) and 11.5  7.2 in ia - negative children ( between 5 and 20 bands ) at 12 months of age . based on these results \\n the 12-month - old group was chosen for further analysis of immune reactivity against bifidobacterium spp \\n igg bound to bifidobacterium antigens in the molecular weight ranging from 7  kda to 131  kda . \\n the number of proteins recognized varied between strains with the greatest number of reactive antigens observed for b. longum dsm 20088 ( n = 57 ; table 1 ) . the average number of igg - reactive proteins in assays with b. adolescentis dsm 20083 , b. adolescentis dsm 20086 , and b. longum dsm 20088 strains was not significantly different between ia - positive children and ia - negative subjects ( figures 13 ) . \\n iga bound to protein antigens in the molecular weight ranging from 7  kda to 104  kda ( table 1 ) . similar to the igg antibody results , more b. longum dsm 20088 proteins were recognized by iga than any other tested bacteria . \\n the average number of b. adolescentis dsm 20083 proteins bound by iga was lower than the number of proteins bound from other strains . \\n there was a significant difference in the number of proteins reactive to antibodies between the 2 groups of children : 1.9  2.6 reactive protein bands in ia - positive infants and 1.2  1.2 reactive protein bands in ia - negative children ( p < 0.003 ; figure 1 ) . \\n also in tests with bifidobacterium strains the average number of reacting antigenic proteins tended to be at a higher frequency in the ia - positive group compared to the ia - negative group ( figures 2 and 3 ) . \\n igm bound to bacterial proteins in the molecular weight ranging from 13  kda to 84  kda . \\n the average number of igm reacting protein bands in both assays either with b. adolescentis dsm 20083 or with b. adolescentis dsm 20086 was higher in ia - positive than in ia - negative infants , but this difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.235 and p = 0.285 , resp . ; \\n this study investigated the reactivity of serum antibodies against the probiotic strain l. rhamnosus gg and selected natural bifidobacterium spp . \\n proteins in children 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24 months of age using an immunoblot assay developed previously by our group . \\n l. rhamnosus gg is included into the most commonly used dairy products in finland , whereas all chosen bifidobacterium strains , b. adolescentis dsm 20083 , b. adolescentis dsm 20086 , and b. longum dsm 20088 , are usual inhabitants of the intestinal microbiota . \\n the colonization of newborns with microbes begins during delivery and by 2 months of age 91% of infants are colonized with b. longum , 75% with b. adolescentis , and 57% with lactobacilli group \\n i ( l. rhamnosus , l. casei , and l. paracasei ) . a shift in colonization with b. adolescentis strains towards earlier \\n life has been demonstrated recently   and this has also been observed at the age of 5 years . \\n the population studied here was obtained from the finnish dipp study and divided into 2 groups based on the development of diabetes - associated autoantibodies and t1d over a 10-year followup . \\n immunoblot analyses of bacterial lysates demonstrated a substantial increase in the frequency of igg antibody reactivity to l. rhamnosus gg proteins between 6 and 12 months of age , showing that the most conspicuous increase in antibody production occurred before the age of 12 months . in spite of these age - dependent changes , reactions against l. rhamnosus gg proteins \\n were seen in ia - positive and ia - negative subjects at a similar frequency . \\n this result indicated that igg antibodies reactive to probiotic strain l. rhamnosus gg proteins were not suggestive of progression toward -cell autoimmunity or development of t1d in children . \\n the most important observation made from immunoblot assays testing antibody reactivity to l. rhamnosus gg proteins was the age - related dynamics associated with the development of circulating antibodies to microbial proteins . \\n proteins since these organisms are known to colonize the infant 's gut early in life . \\n we assessed binding to different antigenic proteins from b. adolescentis dsm 20083 , b. adolescentis dsm 20086 , and b. longum dsm 20088 by igg , iga , and igm class antibodies and observed that iga bound significantly more b. adolescentis dsm 20083 strain antigens in children who developed islet autoimmunity and t1d later in life . at the same time we could not find any significant differences between the two groups of children in the frequencies of igg or iga antibodies against other bifidobacteria strains \\n it is noteworthy that we found that b. longum proteins were recognized by igg and iga antibodies to a substantially higher extent compared to other bacteria studied . \\n this phenomenon may indicate a stronger stimulation of the infant 's immune system by b. longum protein antigens \\n . some of the immunoreactive bands detected may be due to cross - reactive antibodies that developed in response to bacterial antigens from species not used in this study . \\n it is however very difficult to make this distinction since we presently have no tools ( monoclonal antibodies ) to discriminate between strain - specific reactivity and cross - reactivity . \\n regardless , it was clear that differences in the development of iga antibodies with reactivity against b. adolescentis dsm 20083 ( atcc 15703 ) antigens were present independent of the mechanism involved . \\n it is of particular importance to note that differences between the 2 groups were associated with reactivity by iga but not igg or igm class antibodies . \\n iga with reactivity against commensal intestinal microbes can develop as a consequence of colonization with high numbers of organisms at the mucosal surface . \\n it has been shown that oral administration of the probiotic mixture vsl#3 that includes 8 different probiotic strains ( including 3 bifidobacteria strains ) prevented the development of autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice . \\n different bifidobacteria strains have clearly been shown to have variable influences on immune responses [ 23 , 24 ] . \\n the species of b. adolescentis most commonly isolated from allergic children has been shown to more effectively trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines compared to other strains of bifidobacteria [ 25 , 26 ] supporting our results that demonstrated differences between children with and without signs of -cell autoimmunity with regard to reactivity to b. adolescentis strain 20083 antigens which might impact t1d development . \\n whether these differences are in some way linked to differences in the microbiome needs further studies [ 27 , 28 ] . in conclusion , during the first year of life the immune system starts to produce antibodies which recognize antigens produced by organisms comprising the normal microbiota . \\n although some of these proteins may contain common antigenic epitopes present on proteins produced by various bacteria , our current study showed that differences in antibody reactivities could be found even between the same species of b. adolescentis . \\n these differences might reflect a propensity for developing t1d confirming recent findings regarding differences in the gut microbiome between children affected and unaffected by t1d . \\n further studies will be needed to verify how the presence of this particular b. adolescentis dsm 20083 strain in the intestine of children is involved in predisposing individuals to developing -cell autoimmunity and t1d .\", 'output': 'the intestinal microbiota is essential to the maturation and homeostasis of the immune system . \\n immunoblot assays were used to establish the prevalence of serum igg , igm , and iga antibodies specific for bifidobacterium adolescentis , bifidobacterium longum , and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg proteins in young children presenting with or without type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) . \\n we demonstrated that children between the ages of 6 and 12 months had a substantial increase in the frequency of igg antibodies specific for l. rhamnosus gg proteins . \\n we measured igg , igm , and iga class antibody reactivity against b. adolescentis dsm 20083 , b. adolescentis dsm 20086 , and b. longum dsm 20088 proteins demonstrating significantly higher iga responses against b. adolescentis dsm 20083 strain proteins in children who developed islet autoimmunity and t1d later in life . \\n b. adolescentis strains showed more igm type antibodies in children who developed t1d later in life , but the difference was not statistically significant . \\n b. longum proteins were recognized by igg and iga antibodies to a higher extent compared to other bacteria studied . \\n these results confirm that differences in immune reactivity against some commensal strains in young children may represent a different risk factor for developing t1d .', '__index_level_0__': 30474}\n",

rated health , poor cognitive status , impaired ability to perform activities of daily living , two or more clinic visits in the past month , and slow walking speed.14 another explanation for the complex relationships among falls , depression , and cognitive decline may be due to subsequent events following development of one of the conditions . \\n . falls in older persons have been associated with development of fear of falls,15 with a subsequent decrease in levels of physical activity , walking , participation in social activities , and an increase in loneliness and social isolation.1519 over time , reduced social and physical activity may lead to onset of depression and future cognitive decline.2022 we wanted to explore this hypothesis further by testing whether , in a group of cognitively intact elders , recurrent falls would be independently associated with faster cognitive decline , and whether presence of depression would at least in part mediate this association . because of the high prevalence of depressive symptoms and cognitive impairments in older mexican american adults,11,23,24 a fast growing segment of the us population , we wanted to test whether having a fall would trigger social isolation , depression , and subsequent worsening of cognition . to avoid the floor effects of the mmse \\n , we chose to include only those with normal baseline cognition ( mmse 21 ) , a cut -

up period . \\n we also found that , among a cohort of cognitively normal elders , those with history of recurrent falls experienced a greater decline in their cognitive function over a 6-year period compared to those with no history of falls . \\n the fall  cognitive - decline association was independent of age , sex , marital status , and education . \\n presence of high depressive symptoms partially mediated the relationship between falls and cognitive decline . as expected , and consistent with prior studies , a high level of education and high performance in hand grip muscle strength \\n our findings are similar to prior studies and different from others.912,3335 most studies have looked at the falls  cognition association from the perspective of falls - related brain injury versus no injury as predictors of cognitive decline.3335 others have studied risks and consequences of falls in the dementia population , or gait disorders as predictors of cognitive decline or dementia , mostly in non - hispanic populations.36,37 ours is the first study to show that recurrent falls independently predict future cognitive decline in a cohort of community - dwelling hispanic elders with normal baseline cognitive measure . \\n it is not clear how recurrent falls predict cognitive decline , but one possibility is a shared risk factor for both falls and cognitive decline ( eg , strokes , shared brain network for cognition and gait control , low vitamin d , and brain amyloids).3841 for example , low vitamin d levels are associated with falls , depression , and cognitive impairments.38,39 a 12-month prospective cohort study of cognitively normal , community - dwelling older adults ( n=125 , mean age = 75 years ) showed that higher levels of brain amyloid ( pittsburgh compound b retention ) and of cerebrospinal fluid tau / a42 biomarker ratios were significantly associated with increased risk of falls.42 these amyloid imaging markers have been well described in persons with mild cognitive impairment and dementia.43,44 lack of amyloid imaging data precludes us from testing the association between amyloid burden and recurrent falls in our subjects with incident cognitive decline . \\n this is an important area for further study , using a combination of amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker . \\n were such an association proven , recurrent falls might alert clinicians to patients with high risk of future dementia . \\n the literature supports our findings of an association of falls with depressive symptoms and subsequent cognitive decline.1422,45 a 12-year longitudinal study of 2,425 cognitively intact adults showed that high depressive symptoms were associated with accelerated decline in memory , compared to low depressive symptoms as measured with the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale.45 this association suggests that older adults who fall should be monitored for depression . \\n another possible explanation for falls  cognitive - decline association is that recurrent fallers are simply sicker than non - fallers , with more conditions ( eg , diabetes , heart attacks ) that contribute to the mmse decline seen in recurrent fallers . \\n our study indicated that recurrent fallers at baseline were more likely than non - fallers to have lower handgrip muscle strength , hypertension , diabetes , heart attacks , and stroke . \\n our findings linking falls to cognitive decline still remained significant after adjustment for these conditions . \\n clearly , efforts to prevent falls - related disabilities require multidimensional approaches to address not just multiple risk factors , but also cognitive , physical , and emotional consequences of falls . \\n the world alzheimer report states that the earlier the diagnosis of dementia , the better the patients outcome.46 since falls appear to be a predictor of subsequent cognitive decline , health care professionals may be able to detect patients at risk for dementia and implement preventive strategies . \\n possibilities of such strategies include , but are not limited to , physical activity , mediterranean diet , and smoking cessation.6,21,26,43,46 clinically , our study also suggests that those who fell , even if cognitively intact , should be screened over time not only for cognitive impairment , but also for emergence of depressive symptomatology , with the expectation that such screening will trigger timely interventions to improve psychological health and reduce future falls . \\n depression in fallers could be caused by a fear of having another fall , a syndrome that may be amenable to interventions . \\n after a first fall , the fear of falling increases and could cause an adult to withdraw from activities as a defense against future falls . \\n this activity restriction may manifest as depression.1720 depression is thought to increase the likelihood of cognitive decline.10,11,47 however , caution should be used while prescribing antidepressants to patients who have fallen as studies have shown that these medications cause an increased risk in falling equal to that of untreated depression.16,48 nonpharmacological treatment of these patients may be the most effective option.16 our study has several limitations . \\n generalizability of our findings to other populations is limited because of the low educational attainment ( mean years = 6.3 ) and advanced age ( mean age = 80.8 years ) of our subjects . \\n the h - epese data for falls and comorbidities were self - reported , raising the possibility of recall bias , especially if participants have impaired cognition . \\n . we also could not confirm participant self - reports of medical conditions because of unavailability of participants medical records , radiologic imaging , and blood tests . \\n however , recent studies have validated the reliability of self - reports in studies on fears of falling in cognitively intact and impaired older adults and on barriers to mobility after stroke.49,50 the mmse is used primarily as a screening assessment for cognitive function and has limited sensitivity to detect changes over time , particularly in specialized areas of cognition . \\n thus , the rate of cognitive decline in our study may tend towards an underestimation . \\n our study has several strengths : large community - based sample , prospective design , and exploration of the potential role of falls and depression in cognitive disablement in older mexican americans ( a rapidly growing segment of us elderly population ) . \\n another important strength of our study is the use of mixed models , an analytic approach that allowed the use of all available data and evaluation of time - dependent effects . \\n in conclusion , having recurrent falls was independently associated with steeper decline in cognition over 6 years compared to having no history of falls , with a mediating effect of depression on the association between falls and cognitive decline . \\n the findings suggest that screening for cognitive and emotional problems in recurrent fallers might help stem the onset of falls - related physical and cognitive disability . \\n future studies should explore the best way to screen for and treat depression and fear of falling in older adults who have fallen .', 'output': 'backgroundlittle is known about long -

We investigated whether RTC apoptosis requires caspase cleavage of NHE1. Staurosporine- and hypertonic NaCl-induced RTC apoptosis was associated with cell shrinkage and diminished cytosolic pH, and apoptosis was potentiated by amiloride analogs, suggesting NHE1 activity opposes apoptosis. NHE1-deficient fibroblasts demonstrated increased susceptibility to apoptosis, which was reversed by NHE1 reconstitution.

Below is my query and your answer - I am a male of 48 years of age. I have a lean build and do regular exercise. Since childhood, I had a tendency for heart palpitations and premature beats. After a few tests, anxiety was found to be the main cause.  You had said that most probably these premature complexes are originating from ventricles which are leading to the symptoms. These are usually benign and not life threatening. The only concern remains is that of coronary artery disease, which is also less likely as these are occurring from a long time and you are not having any other symptoms. Lack of sleep, stress, alcohol, smoking, caffeinated beverages are known triggering factors for these due to sympathetic overactivity. You should also get thyroid test done. I think, just be on a safer side, you should get one treadmill test done to rule out coronary artery disease and echo should be repeated. Afterwards, I met a cardiologist and got an ECG and echo tests done. The tests were normal. The cardiologist said that there is no need for TMT test since I do running and other exercises daily and there is no known risk factor for CAD. But the VPCs continued for a month.Then, I realized that I was taking a weight gainer supplement from the last one year which contained creatinine. Two months back, I was not doing any exercise due to a small fracture in my elbow but continued to take this supplement. The doctor advised me to stop the supplement immediately since this could be the cause of missed beats. Then I read in the internet and found out that there have been cases of irregular heart beats due to creatinine supplementation. I stopped taking the supplement although it was from a reputed firm and did not contain any steroids. The missed beats reduced after stopping the supplement and from the last two months, it has come to a normal level of one or two in a day. But somehow my mind started getting preoccupied with the thoughts of heart disease and I started reading about it from the internet and even textbooks.I have been thin and slim since my childhood, have been quite active physically, no family history of heart disease, no diabetes, no hypertension, non-smoker, rarely eat fried foods. My lipid profile is normal with HDL being about 55 whenever tested, CRP is around 0.5. But in spite of this, I was not able to free my mind from worries of CAD. A month back, I did quite a lot of pushups after a gap of four to five months. After three to four days, I started having pain in my chest here and there mostly at rest. After a week I got an ECG done which was normal. The pain subsided slowly but whenever I did some exercise which put a strain on the chest muscle I started having pain and with pain, more worries.Then I met a psychiatrist. He said that I have got into an obsessive loop, which is part of health anxiety disorder which is causing these psychosomatic symptoms of chest pain. He advised me to take some antidepressants for three months, do Yoga and meditation and take some sessions of cognitive behavior therapy. I am reluctant to take antidepressants but have already started doing some meditation and Yoga. He also prescribed Alprazolam .25 mg on SOS basis. Now the pain is subsiding slowly and obsessive thoughts are also reducing. I have stopped doing any exercise that would put a strain on the chest. I do not know how long it will take to resume it. In a recent blood test, two months back my vitamin D3 was at 28. Could it be the cause of the chest pain? Secondly, I stopped the supplement but continued some strenuous exercises without taking a proper diet. Could it be the cause of it? Please guide me. How to get rid of this unwanted health anxiety which I have got into?', 'output': 'Hello. Looking at the overall picture, the problem appears to be a minor one and not worrisome. All the best.

All the reports came back normal except my urine report. My chemical examination of urine says there is blood in the urine and the microscopic examination says pus cells and RBCs are present. I contacted my doctor immediately and he suggested to go for urine culture and sensitivity. The report came after three days and it looks normal as well. It says, no growth noticed at the end of 48 hours of incubation and microscopic examination says occasional pus cells and no microorganisms were seen. The doctor said not to worry and that everything is alright. He suggested taking more water. He also mentioned that the ultrasound report is also normal. I searched on the internet about RBCs in the blood and saw some very strange articles which scared me a lot. I request you to kindly help me out and suggest what I should do.', 'output': 'Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.
