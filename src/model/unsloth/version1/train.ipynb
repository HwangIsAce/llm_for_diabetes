We hypothesized that AMPK-induced autophagy ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and examined the effects of AMPK on the interaction between Beclin1 and Bcl-2, a switch between autophagy and apoptosis, in diabetic mice and high glucose-treated H9c2 cardiac myoblast cells. Exposure of H9c2 cells to high glucose reduced AMPK activity, inhibited Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1)-B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) signaling, and promoted Beclin1 binding to Bcl-2. Conversely, activation of AMPK by metformin stimulated JNK1-Bcl-2 signaling and disrupted the Beclin1-Bcl-2 complex. Activation of AMPK, which normalized cardiac autophagy, attenuated high glucose-induced apoptosis in cultured H9c2 cells. This effect was attenuated by inhibition of autophagy. Finally, chronic administration of metformin in diabetic mice restored cardiac autophagy by activating JNK1-Bcl-2 pathways and dissociating Beclin1 and Bcl-2. The induction of autophagy protected against cardiac apoptosis and improved cardiac structure and function in diabetic mice. We concluded that dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis.', 'output': 'glucose, metformin, AMP, NH2', 'text_length': 2872, '__index_level_0__': 42245}\n",

We previously found that the Akt/PKB ortholog AKT-1 dampens the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress in the germline by negatively regulating the p53-like transcription factor CEP-1. Here, we report unexpected rearrangements to the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, whereby the insulin-like receptor DAF-2 and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK-1 oppose AKT-1 to promote DNA damage-induced apoptosis. While DNA damage does not affect phosphorylation at the PDK-1 site Thr350/Thr308 of AKT-1, it increased phosphorylation at Ser517/Ser473. Although ablation of daf-2 or pdk-1 completely suppressed akt-1-dependent apoptosis, the transcriptional activation of CEP-1 was unaffected, suggesting that daf-2 and pdk-1 act independently or downstream of cep-1 and akt-1. Ablation of the akt-1 paralog akt-2 or the downstream target of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway daf-16 (a FOXO transcription factor) restored sensitivity to damage-induced apoptosis in daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants. In addition, daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants have reduced levels of phospho-MPK-1/ERK in their germ cells, indicating that the insulin/IGF-1 pathway promotes Ras signaling in the germline. Ablation of the Ras effector gla-3, a negative regulator of mpk-1, restored sensitivity to apoptosis in daf-2 mutants, suggesting that gla-3 acts downstream of daf-2. In addition, the hypersensitivity of let-60/Ras gain-of-function mutants to damage-induced apoptosis was suppressed to wild-type levels by ablation of daf-2. Thus, insulin/IGF-1 signaling selectively engages AKT-2/DAF-16 to promote DNA damage-induced germ cell apoptosis downstream of CEP-1 through the Ras pathway.', 'output': 'phospho, phosphoinositide, Ser', 'text_length': 2536, '__index_level_0__': 43185}\n",

r  interval ( bazett , 1920 ) . \\n the standard 12-lead ecg was recorded at 25  mm / s along with a lead ii rhythm strip recorded at 50  mm / s ; qt and rr intervals were measured . \\n qt interval was measured from the onset of the qrs complex to the end of t wave . \\n the end of qt interval was defined as the intersection of a tangent to the steepest downslope of the dominant repolarization wave with the isoelectric line . \\n three separate measurements were obtained from each ecg , and the mean of these measurements was used as the value for the qtc . \\n prolonged qtc was defined as a qtc of at least 0.45  s ( 450  ms ) . \\n qt - interval dispersion was defined as the difference between maximum and minimum non - rate - corrected qt - interval duration . \\n follow - up ecgs was recorded at time of hospital discharge or at patient 's first outpatient visit ( median 22 days after initial ecg with a range from 5 to 30 days ) . \\n collected data were analyzed using spss program version 16 to obtain the quantitative variables as mean  sd and range and qualitative variables as number and percentage . \\n p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant and p values less than 0.01 were considered statistically highly significant . \\n qtc was found to be prolonged ( more than 450  ms ) in 16 patients : 9 patients with new onset diabetes and 7 patients with known diabetes during dka ( range 451539  ms ) . \\n the mean qtc values of patients during dka were 450  89  ms , which were significantly decreased after recovery from dka ( 428  2  5  ms , p < 0.001 ) . \\n only one child had persistent prolonged qtc ( 453  ms ) even after recovery from dka which returned to normal 5 days after hospital discharge ( table 2 ) . \\n nineteen patients ( 63.3% ) had prolonged qtd ( > 50  ms ) : 10 were newly diagnosed patients with type 1 dm and 9 patients were known diabetics . \\n three children had persistent prolongation of qtd after recovery from dka and were returned to normal within one week after hospital discharge . \\n three patients were found to have normal qtc ( 444  ms , 447  ms , and 445  ms , resp . ) although they have increased qtd ( 51  ms , 52  ms , and 51 , resp . ) . \\n none of the children enrolled in the study experienced cardiac arrhythmias during dka treatment .   during dka , patients with prolonged qtc and those with prolonged qtd had a significant higher anion gap and lower ph at presentation compared to those with normal qtc and qtd values , while no significant difference was found between both groups of patients in other biochemical or clinical data ( tables 3 and 4 ) . \\n the initial anion gap was positively correlated with qtc values ( r = 0.67 , p < 0.0001 ) ( figure 1 ) and qtd value ( r = 0.69 , p < 0.001 ) during dka . \\n none of children experienced hypoxia or hypoglycemia ( blood glucose level < 70  mg / dl ) , 5 patients had mild hypokalemia at the time of ecg recording ( range from 3.1 to 3.3 \\n meq / l ) , while s. mg and s. ca were within reference range in all patients with no significant correlation between s. ca , k , and mg with qtc or qtd was found . \\n arrhythmias and cardiac arrest have been reported as complications of dka and generally have been presumed to be caused by electrolyte abnormalities . in the present study , qtc and qtd prolongation were found in 16 and 19 patients , respectively , during dka . \\n after recovery , only one patient had persistent qtc prolongation and 3 had persistent qtd prolongation which returned to normal within one week following discharge . since patients had no electrolyte disturbances ( hypokalemia , hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia ) or hypoglycemia that could account for qtc prolongation , so the role of ketoacidosis in causing such prolongation and delayed cardiac repolarization was suggested . \\n prolongation of qt interval is a serious condition that provides substrate for the development of potentially life - threatening arrhythmias torsade de pointes . \\n previous studies supported the association of other ketotic conditions with qtc prolongation and deaths in patients receiving ketogenic diets [ 2 , 9 , 12 ] . \\n the fact that three patients who had normal qtc were found to have increased qtd increases the privilege of qtd as a better marker of cardiac risk than qtc in those patients . \\n this result agreed with that reported by rana et al . who found prolonged qtd to be the best predictor for cardiac death in patients with dm . \\n moreover , psallas et al . found that prolonged qtd interval may predict cardiac mortality in patients with diabetes and suggested that it may be a useful adjuvant index in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria . \\n children with long - standing diabetes but without dka reported to have prolonged qtc and a greater frequency of other abnormalities in cardiac autonomic function compared with age - matched control subjects . \\n those abnormalities were thought to be manifestations of diabetic neuropathy . in the present study qtc prolongation \\n could not be attributed to preexisting manifestations of diabetic neuropathy because qtc returned to normal after recovery from dka in most of children . \\n in addition , qtc prolongation was present in patients with new onset dm in addition to those with known diabetes . \\n the anion gap was significantly greater at presentation in children with a prolonged qtc and qtd . \\n in addition , a significant positive correlation was found between qtc and qtd values and initial anion gap in patients during dka reflecting the role of ketosis in causing qtc and/or qtd prolongation , which agreed with best et al . who described qtc prolongation in children receiving ketogenic diets . \\n the only limitation of the present study is the use of anion gap as an indicator of ketosis without measuring serum ketonesconcentration .   in conclusion\", 'output': 'cardiac arrest has been described in children with diabetic ketoacidosis ( dka ) . \\n aim . to evaluate qtc and qtd in type 1 diabetic children with dka \\n . methods . \\n twelve -

term exposure to phthalates can hasten the diabetic process and thereby precipitate the occurrence of diabetic complications . \\n thus , it can be conjectured that even after the onset of t2d is triggered , the severity of diabetes , as manifested by its complications , may also be modulated by environmental challenges . \\n alternatively or concomitantly , it is also plausible that acceleration of progress to retinopathy subsequent to phthalate exposure may be a result of a direct effect on the retina . \\n it is instructive in this regard that dehp is known to partake in retinal vessel remodeling . \\n also , dimethyl phthalate ( dmp ) , diethyl phthalate ( dep ) , and dehp have been shown to influence the activity of retinal aldolase . \\n however , the relative contribution of phthalate exposure to these two possible mechanisms is currently unknown . in this study \\n , we hypothesized that phthalate exposure is associated with eye -

reported eye affliction / retinopathy . \\n self - reported eye affliction / retinopathy was defined as an affirmative answer to the following question :  has a doctor ever told you that diabetes has affected your eyes or that you had retinopathy ?  an estimated 13.87% of the 1,004 study participants reported this outcome . \\n we examined the validity of this outcome by comparing it with the results of ophthalmologist 's reports of detailed eye and retinal examination . \\n the ophthalmological assessment was available only for the nhanes 2005 - 2006 and nhanes 2007 - 2008 cycles . \\n these data are based on images of two fundus examinations captured using a nonmydriatic digital camera and the grading was based on the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study severity scale [ 1618 ] . \\n the images were graded as no retinopathy , mild nonproliferative retinopathy ( npr ) , moderate / severe npr , and proliferative retinopathy ( pr ) . \\n pr was defined as presence of neovascularization on the retinal surface or abnormal growth of new retinal blood vessels into the vitreous . \\n urinary phthalate metabolites have been measured in a random subsample of nhanes participants ( http://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/ and [ 19 , 20 ] ) . \\n briefly , frozen urine samples ( 20c ) were assayed using a combination of solid - phase extraction , high performance liquid chromatography , and tandem mass spectrometry . \\n concentrations below the corresponding limit of detection ( lod ) were replaced by lod/2 . although the nhanes 20012010 dataset contained information on 15 phthalate metabolites ( table 1 ) , complete measurements on all the included individuals were available for the following 12 phthalate metabolites : mono - n - butyl phthalate ( mbp ) , mono - cyclohexyl phthalate ( mcp ) , mono - ethyl phthalate ( mep ) , mono-(2-ethyl)-hexyl phthalate ( mehp ) , mono - isononyl phthalate ( mnp ) , mono - n - octyl phthalate ( mop ) , mono - benzyl phthalate ( mbzp ) , mono - n - methyl phthalate ( mnm ) , mono-(3-carboxypropyl ) phthalate ( mcpp ) , mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl ) phthalate ( mehhp ) , mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl ) phthalate ( meohp ) , and mono - isobutyl phthalate ( mibp ) . \\n distribution of the urinary phthalate concentrations in the study participants is shown in table 1 . \\n in addition to urinary concentrations of 12 phthalate metabolites , we considered the following potential confounders : age , sex , race , marital status , educational attainment , poverty income ratio , physical activity ( measured as metabolic equivalent hours and categorized as recommended by ) , glycated hemoglobin levels , total serum cholesterol , serum high - density lipoprotein cholesterol , serum triglycerides , blood pressure , duration of diabetes , total calorie intake ( estimated from dietary questionnaires ) , and obesity ( defined on the basis of body mass index , bmi ) . \\n distribution of these variables in the study participants and the coding schemes used in analyses are shown in table 1 . to ensure that all the selected study participants are represented in all the multivariable models , we coded the missing values of confounders as zero . \\n all the analyses were conducted using the stata 12.0 ( statacorp , college station , tx ) software package . to ensure a normal distribution of urinary phthalate metabolites and the use of a common metric for all the urinary phthalates \\n , we performed a two - step transformation of the urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites . in the first step , we corrected for urinary dilution by calculating log ratio of the phthalate metabolite concentration and urinary creatinine concentration . in the second step , we inverse - normalized this log ratio by ( i ) ranking the values , ( ii ) creating a cumulative density function based on the ranks , and ( iii ) using the invnorm ( ) function in stata to create a variable distributed as n(0,1 ) . \\n the histograms of raw values , values corrected for dilution , and the inverse - normalized values for each urinary phthalate metabolite are shown in figures  s1s15 in supplementary material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/7269896 . to examine the validity of self - reported retinopathy , we estimated cohen 's kappa . to assess the robustness of the observed associations with self - reported eye affliction / retinopathy , we ran 5000 replicates using monte carlo simulations . \\n in these simulations , we applied the misclassification rates observed in the validity subsample to the whole sample and estimated the association using the full logistic regression model that included all the covariates mentioned earlier . \\n we used the svy set of commands to adjust for the sampling weights and design variables as recommended by the centers for disease control ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/ ) . \\n descriptive statistics such as means and proportions were also adjusted for the survey design variables . \\n the association analyses employed univariate and multivariable logistic regression and were conducted using the logistic subcommand of the svy command . for the univariate analyses , we corrected the significance values for multiple comparisons using the bonferroni method . \\n hypothesis of for dose - response relationship was tested using the armitage test for linear trend . \\n when each phthalate metabolite was separately regressed on the study outcome in a univariate fashion ( table 2 ) , only mop was significantly associated with eye affliction / retinopathy such that one standard deviation increase in urinary mop was associated with a 1.39 times higher likelihood ( bonferroni - corrected p = 0.048 ) of eye affliction / retinopathy in participants with diabetes . to test the robustness of this observation \\n , we first conducted a series of multivariable analyses since there was a complex pattern of correlations among the 12 phthalate metabolites ( table s1 ) . \\n for the multivariable analyses , we conducted a forward stepwise logistic regression retaining all the included covariates in each step . \\n firstly we included all the 12 urinary phthalates as covariates and found that mop was significantly associated with the study outcome . \\n stepwise addition of all the other demographic and clinical variables did not influence the independent association of mop . \\n the results from the final model including all 26 covariates in addition to mop are shown in table s2 . \\n the final model identified three significant predictors of self - reported eye affliction / retinopathy : mop ( or 2.02 , 95% ci 1.223.35 ) , low hdl cholesterol ( or 0.54 , 95% ci 0.330.89 ) , and duration of diabetes ( or 1.95 , 95% ci 1.622.33 ) . \\n data on self - reported eye affliction / retinopathy and ophthalmological examination was available on 285 participants with t2d ( table 4 ) . in these participants , \\n the prevalence of mild nonproliferative retinopathy , moderate / severe nonproliferative retinopathy , and proliferative retinopathy was 23.8 , 7.7 , and 1.6% , respectively . \\n the proportion of self - reported eye affliction / retinopathy was 11% , 15% , 46% , and 48% in participants who had no retinopathy , mild npr , moderate / severe npr , and pr , respectively . \\n there was an 82.01% agreement between these two outcomes which translated into a cohen 's kappa of 0.31 ( p = 1.2  10 ) . \\n as evidenced from the results shown in table 4 , 19 participants ( design - corrected proportion 4.92% ) who had moderate / severe npr or pr were missed by self - reported retinopathy / eye affliction indicating possible underreporting . on the other hand \\n , there were 33 ( design - corrected proportion 11.2% ) participants who reported eye affliction / retinopathy but did not have corroborative imaging data . \\n since ophthalmologically determined retinopathy was available in only 285 participants , the full set of association analyses could not be run on this smaller subsample . \\n instead , we generated 5000 replicates using a monte carlo procedure in which the cases and controls of self - reported eye affliction / retinopathy were randomly reshuffled based on the misclassification rates ( 11.2% and 4.92% ) observed in the validation subsample . \\n for each of these replicates , we ran the full logistic regression model shown in table 3 ( model 16 ) and determined distribution of the regression coefficient for the association of inverse - normalized mop with self - reported eye affliction / retinopathy . \\n we observed ( figure 2 ) that the estimated regression coefficient followed a normal distribution with a mean of 0.4947 which translates to an or of 1.64 ( 95% ci 1.082.50 ) . \\n these results imply that even if one accounts for possible errors of misclassifying of cases and controls of retinopathy due to self - reporting , the association of mop would still be significant . \\n we next examined if there was evidence for a dose - response relationship of the inverse - normalized urinary mop concentration and prevalence of eye affliction / retinopathy . \\n we found that indeed there was a clearly significant linear increase in the prevalence based on the dose of mop ( figure 3 ) . \\n the prevalence of self - reported eye affliction / retinopathy steadily increased from 0.07 ( in participants with > 1 sd below mean mop ) to 0.21 ( in participants with > 1 sd above mean mop ) . \\n armitage test for linear trend showed a significantly linear association ( p = 0.004 ) between urinary mop and self - reported retinopathy / eye affliction . since mop is a rarer metabolite of dnop , we investigated whether the observed concentrations were confounded by the ability of the assay to detect this metabolite in urine . \\n we found that in 73% of the participants included in this study the urinary concentration of mop was above the lower limit of detection ( 0.84  ng / ml ) . \\n secondly , we created a variable to capture the molar sum of dnop derivatives ( mop and mcpp ) and tested the association of the molar sum of dnop with self - reported eye affliction / retinopathy . \\n we found that this association was not statistically significant ( or 0.92 , 95% ci 0.761.12 , p = 0.393 ) . \\n our results indicate a specific , robust , independent , and statistically significant association of urinary mop concentration with the likelihood of self - reported eye affliction / retinopathy in a nationally representative sample of participants with diabetes from the united states . \\n interestingly , of the three metabolites of dehp , mehp , mehhp , and meohp , none showed a statistically trending association ( in the multivariable adjusted model ) . \\n since mop is a metabolite of dnop , our study has identified exposure to dnop as a potentially important contributor to ocular complications of diabetes . \\n it is intriguing , however , that the other metabolite of dnop ( mcpp ) was not significantly associated with self - reported eye affliction / retinopathy . in the metabolism of dnop , mop is the result of the first step of hydrolysis while mcpp is the result of the next step of oxidation . \\n it is conceivable , for example , that the enzymatic progression from the stage of hydrolysis to oxidation may be dysfunctional or subfunctional in dr resulting in an increase in mop without significantly affecting the concentration of the downstream metabolite ( mcpp ) . \\n direct in vitro and ex vivo studies need to be undertaken to demonstrate these postulated perturbations in the metabolic pathway of phthalates but our results point towards this interesting and putative hypothesis . \\n our results also indicate that phthalate exposure may be associated with not only an increased likelihood of t2d but also its complications . \\n notably , our sample included non - dr diabetic patients as controls and , therefore , the observed associations are indicative of an epidemiological link between dr and mop rather than between underlying diabetes and mop . while making these and other conclusions from this study , it must be considered that these results only provide associative evidence and therefore causal conclusions need to be refrained from . \\n it is also noteworthy that we observed an association of low hdl cholesterol with self - reported retinopathy . \\n it is generally believed that low hdl is not associated with diabetic retinopathy [ 2325 ] . \\n for example , in a study by sasongko et al . , it was found that of all the routinely used lipid measures , low hdl provided the most significant and independent contribution to prediction of dr . \\n other studies from united states , china , and india   also provide supportive evidence to the association of low hdl and dr . \\n it is instructive , in this regard , that the global multicentric case - control study of dr   and the italian riace study   posit that the observed association between low hdl and dr can be partly explained on the basis of coexisting chronic kidney complications of diabetes . \\n we did not have data on coexisting diabetic nephropathy and therefore can not comment on the possibility of a nephropathy driven association between low hdl and dr . \\n together , published literature does not offer a definitive answer on the association of low hdl with dr . \\n future studies need to carefully address this issue using a combination of meta - analytical and mechanistic approaches . \\n if indeed mop is a player in the complex web of diabetic retinopathy then a biological rationale for such a finding deserves consideration . \\n diabetic retinopathy typically results in neovascularization of retinal vessels with a consequent bleeding into the vitreous and/or macular edema . \\n this process has a strong genetic basis . in an elegant recent review , murea et al \\n .   enlisted eight genes that have been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy . \\n phthalates have been shown to alter expression of or signaling through several of these genes [ 3340 ] and one of these genes partakes in the pathway orchestrated by the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma gene ( ppar ) , a known target of all phthalates including mop . \\n thus , there may be a genetic basis to the possible precipitation of diabetic retinopathy by exposure to mop . also , using an in silico approach , jananie et al . \\n recently demonstrated that phthalates can bind angiotensin ii type 1 ( at1 ) receptor which plays a central role in diabetic retinopathy . \\n action of at1 in the retinal microvessels and pericytes can contribute to diabetic retinopathy [ 4244 ] . whether this mechanism is operational in exposure \\n however , the plethora of animal and human studies that point towards a consistent association of some phthalates with retinopathy provide an indirect ( and , admittedly , insufficient ) evidence for a biological basis to the association of mop with diabetic retinopathy observed in this study . \\n although recall bias can be expected to be low for this outcome , such a bias can not be eliminated . \\n validation of this outcome based on retinal imaging studies also indicated that some misclassification was evident . \\n however , our analyses using monte carlo simulation indicate that the potential misclassification due to an alloyed outcome used in this study is unlikely to negate the association of mop with diabetic retinopathy . \\n second , urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites only indirectly imply environmental exposure . the pattern , dose , and modes of actual exposure to phthalates can not be discerned from this study . thus , whether the associations reflect a cumulative risk due to sustained exposure can not be reliably answered from these data . \\n third , since the temporal sequence of phthalate exposure and complications of diabetes is unknown , the evidence presented here can at best be considered associative and not causal . \\n urinary phthalate concentrations are considered to be a reasonable biomarker of chronic exposure to phthalates . \\n since the biological effects of phthalate exposure are likely reversible , our results beckon a critical and intensive look into the potential role of mop in diabetic retinopathy . \\n the ubiquity of dnop in products like flooring tiles and cosmetics   entails that future studies need to carefully dissect out the putative epidemiological link observed in this study .\", 'output': \"background . an epidemiological association between exposure to phthalates and type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) is known . \\n however , the potential role of environmental phthalates in the complications of t2d is unknown . methods . using data from the national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ) 20012010 , we studied the association of 12 urinary phthalate metabolites with self -

it is likely that sufficient macrophages accumulate in db/+ mice but not in db / db mice . \\n thus , it is possible that db/+ mice have a sufficient amount of growth factors in the wound and wound fluid to permit a maximal rate of healing , and therefore , only a minor increase in wound repair can result from the application of autologous ascs . \\n in addition , the wound closure assay and histological examinations used in this study might not be sensitive enough to detect small effects . \\n ascs from both db / db and db/+ mice proliferated with identical growth rates , produced type i collagen , and secreted a number of angiogenic cytokines at similar levels . wound healing experiments using the db / db mouse model showed that the application of acm containing autologous ascs onto an open wound induced the formation of significant granulation tissue , epithelium , and capillaries , thereby accelerating wound healing .\", 'output': 'we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of an atelocollagen matrix containing autologous adipose tissue - derived stromal cells ( ascs ) on wound healing in diabetic ( db / db ) mice . \\n cultured ascs from db / db mice and from db/+ mice secreted identical amounts of growth factors , cytokines , and type i collagen . \\n ascs from db / db mice proliferated at the same rate as those from db/+ mice . \\n when dii - labeled ascs were applied to full - thickness round skin wounds on the backs of diabetic db / db mice , histological observation at 2 weeks showed that red fluorescent - labeled tissues were formed in the epidermis , dermis , and capillaries . \\n twelve db / db mice were treated with either matrix alone or matrix containing ascs and then sacrificed at 1 or 2 weeks . \\n a histological examination demonstrated significantly advanced granulation tissue formation , capillary formation , and epithelialization in those wounds treated with atelocollagen matrix containing ascs , compared with wounds treated with matrix alone .', 'text_length': 18776, '__index_level_0__': 42839}\n",

Our group showed earlier that it is possible to generate functional islets from human dental pulp stem cells by using a serum-free cocktail in a three-step protocol. We compared the yield of generated islet-like cell clusters (ICCs) from stem cells from pulps of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) and dental pulp stem cells from permanent teeth (DPSCs).

Context: Hepatocarcinogenesis is a stepwise process. It involves several genetic and epigenetic alterations, e.g., loss of tumor suppressor gene expression (TP53, PTEN, RB) as well as activation of oncogenes (c-MYC, MET, BRAF, RAS). However, the role of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which regulate tumor suppressor and oncogene expression at the posttranscriptional level, are not well understood in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we analyzed RBPs induced in human liver cancer, revealing 116 RBPs with a significant and more than 2-fold higher expression in HCC compared to normal liver tissue. We focused our subsequent analyses on the Insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) representing the most strongly up-regulated RBP in HCC in our cohort. Depletion of IGF2BP1 from multiple liver cancer cell lines inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in vitro. Accordingly, murine xenograft assays after stable depletion of IGF2BP1 reveal that tumor growth, but not tumor initiation, strongly depends on IGF2BP1 in vivo. At the molecular level, IGF2BP1 binds to and stabilizes the c-MYC and MKI67 mRNAs and increases c-Myc and Ki-67 protein expression, two potent regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis. These substrates likely mediate the impact of IGF2BP1 in human liver cancer, but certainly additional target genes contribute to its function.', 'output': 'yes', 'text_length': 1641, '__index_level_0__': 41757}\n",

Vitamin A derivatives/retinoids are involved in several of these processes, which mainly take place in white adipose tissue (WAT). In this study, we examined adiponectin expression as a function of dietary high-fat and high-vitamin A conditions in mice. A decrease of adiponectin expression in addition to an up-regulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase A1 (ALDH1A1), retinoid signaling, and retinoic acid response element signaling was selectively observed in WAT of mice fed a normal-vitamin A, high-fat diet. Reduced adiponectin expression in WAT was also observed in mice fed a high-vitamin A diet. Adipocyte cell culture revealed that endogenous and synthetic retinoic acid receptor (RAR)α- and RARγ-selective agonists, as well as a synthetic retinoid X receptor agonist, efficiently reduced adiponectin expression, whereas ALDH1A1 expression only increased with RAR agonists.', 'output': 'entailment', 'text_length': 1649, '__index_level_0__': 42157}\n",

The liver is the central organ in growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH-IGF) axis. Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can lead to liver problems. Although proinflammatory cytokines are an integral part of inflammation in chronic liver diseases, their involvement in mediating hepatic GH resistance during HCV infection remains to be elucidated. To address this issue, our study aimed at evaluating the influence of HCV infection on serum profile of IGF-1, TNF-alpha and IL-6 to assess their possible relation to hepatic dysfunction and GH resistance development. Twenty-five chronic HCV patients were studied together with 15 healthy control subjects. Serum concentration of IGF-1, TNF-alpha and IL-6 was determined by ELISA. HCV viral load was assessed by Real-time polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan probe technology. Basal serum GH levels were determined by a chemiluminescence assay and serum aminotransferases' activities were also measured. TNF-alpha and IL-6 demonstrated higher serum levels, while IGF-1 levels were significantly lower in HCV patients compared to healthy controls. A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between GH and IL-6 levels (P<0.05), a similar trend was found between GH levels, GH/IGF-1 ratio and AST/ALT ratio (P<0.01, P<0.01, respectively). A significant negative correlation was observed between HCV viral load and GH levels (P<0.05).

On d 15, intestinal protein synthesis and lactase processing were measured in vivo in fed pigs using a 6-h intravenous, overlapping infusion of multiple stable isotopes (2H(3)-Leu, 13C(1)-Leu, 13C(1)-Phe, 2H(5)-Phe, 13C(6)-Phe and 13C(9)-Phe).

Neither dose of IGF-I affected the masses of wet tissue, protein or DNA, or the villus height, cell proliferation or LPH-specific activity. Oral IGF-I decreased the synthesis and abundance of prolactase-phlorizin hydrolase (pro-LPH), but increased brush-border (BB)-LPH synthesis in the ileum. The BB-LPH processing efficiency was twofold to threefold greater in IGF-fed than in control pigs. In all pigs, villus height and the total mucosal and specific activity of LPH activity were greater in the ileum than in the jejunum, yet the synthesis of BB-LPH were significantly lower in the ileum than in the jejunum.\", 'output': 'contradiction', 'text_length': 1744, '__index_level_0__': 42179}\n",

The established method of cytochrome C reduction by superoxide was modified to measure superoxide production in vascular rings from rabbit aortae. The diabetogenic compound alloxan significantly increased superoxide production in a concentration-dependent manner. The nitrovasodilators nitroprusside and minoxidil exhibited contrasting effects. Nitroprusside inhibited alloxan-stimulated production of superoxide, but minoxidil had no effect, suggesting different mechanisms of action for these drugs. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had no effect on the production of superoxide stimulated by alloxan, demonstrating that superoxide production induced by this compound is not affected by mechanisms involving cyclooxygenase. These data demonstrate the use of a simple, rapid and inexpensive method for measuring superoxide produced by intact vessels.

We performed a cross-sectional study of 6,567 Korean men who participated in a health screening program, evaluating the association of serum 25(OH)D(3) levels with the risk of NAFLD assessed by abdominal ultrasonogram. Of the participants, 43.6% had NAFLD and 21.1% had metabolic syndrome.

We hypothesized that AMPK-induced autophagy ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and examined the effects of AMPK on the interaction between Beclin1 and Bcl-2, a switch between autophagy and apoptosis, in diabetic mice and high glucose-treated H9c2 cardiac myoblast cells. Exposure of H9c2 cells to high glucose reduced AMPK activity, inhibited Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1)-B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) signaling, and promoted Beclin1 binding to Bcl-2. Conversely, activation of AMPK by metformin stimulated JNK1-Bcl-2 signaling and disrupted the Beclin1-Bcl-2 complex. Activation of AMPK, which normalized cardiac autophagy, attenuated high glucose-induced apoptosis in cultured H9c2 cells. This effect was attenuated by inhibition of autophagy. Finally, chronic administration of metformin in diabetic mice restored cardiac autophagy by activating JNK1-Bcl-2 pathways and dissociating Beclin1 and Bcl-2. The induction of autophagy protected against cardiac apoptosis and improved cardiac structure and function in diabetic mice. We concluded that dissociation of Bcl-2 from Beclin1 may be an important mechanism for preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy via AMPK activation that restores autophagy and protects against cardiac apoptosis.', 'output': 'glucose, metformin, AMP, NH2', 'text_length': 2872, '__index_level_0__': 42245}\n",

We previously found that the Akt/PKB ortholog AKT-1 dampens the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress in the germline by negatively regulating the p53-like transcription factor CEP-1. Here, we report unexpected rearrangements to the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, whereby the insulin-like receptor DAF-2 and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK-1 oppose AKT-1 to promote DNA damage-induced apoptosis. While DNA damage does not affect phosphorylation at the PDK-1 site Thr350/Thr308 of AKT-1, it increased phosphorylation at Ser517/Ser473. Although ablation of daf-2 or pdk-1 completely suppressed akt-1-dependent apoptosis, the transcriptional activation of CEP-1 was unaffected, suggesting that daf-2 and pdk-1 act independently or downstream of cep-1 and akt-1. Ablation of the akt-1 paralog akt-2 or the downstream target of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway daf-16 (a FOXO transcription factor) restored sensitivity to damage-induced apoptosis in daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants. In addition, daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants have reduced levels of phospho-MPK-1/ERK in their germ cells, indicating that the insulin/IGF-1 pathway promotes Ras signaling in the germline. Ablation of the Ras effector gla-3, a negative regulator of mpk-1, restored sensitivity to apoptosis in daf-2 mutants, suggesting that gla-3 acts downstream of daf-2. In addition, the hypersensitivity of let-60/Ras gain-of-function mutants to damage-induced apoptosis was suppressed to wild-type levels by ablation of daf-2. Thus, insulin/IGF-1 signaling selectively engages AKT-2/DAF-16 to promote DNA damage-induced germ cell apoptosis downstream of CEP-1 through the Ras pathway.', 'output': 'phospho, phosphoinositide, Ser', 'text_length': 2536, '__index_level_0__': 43185}\n",

Context: Hepatocarcinogenesis is a stepwise process. It involves several genetic and epigenetic alterations, e.g., loss of tumor suppressor gene expression (TP53, PTEN, RB) as well as activation of oncogenes (c-MYC, MET, BRAF, RAS). However, the role of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which regulate tumor suppressor and oncogene expression at the posttranscriptional level, are not well understood in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we analyzed RBPs induced in human liver cancer, revealing 116 RBPs with a significant and more than 2-fold higher expression in HCC compared to normal liver tissue. We focused our subsequent analyses on the Insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) representing the most strongly up-regulated RBP in HCC in our cohort. Depletion of IGF2BP1 from multiple liver cancer cell lines inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in vitro. Accordingly, murine xenograft assays after stable depletion of IGF2BP1 reveal that tumor growth, but not tumor initiation, strongly depends on IGF2BP1 in vivo. At the molecular level, IGF2BP1 binds to and stabilizes the c-MYC and MKI67 mRNAs and increases c-Myc and Ki-67 protein expression, two potent regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis. These substrates likely mediate the impact of IGF2BP1 in human liver cancer, but certainly additional target genes contribute to its function.', 'output': 'yes', 'text_length': 1641, '__index_level_0__': 41757}\n",

Long-term, high-fat diet results in gain of body weight, adiposity, further inflammatory-based cardiovascular diseases, and reduced adiponectin secretion. Vitamin A derivatives/retinoids are involved in several of these processes, which mainly take place in white adipose tissue (WAT). In this study, we examined adiponectin expression as a function of dietary high-fat and high-vitamin A conditions in mice. A decrease of adiponectin expression in addition to an up-regulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase A1 (ALDH1A1), retinoid signaling, and retinoic acid response element signaling was selectively observed in WAT of mice fed a normal-vitamin A, high-fat diet. Reduced adiponectin expression in WAT was also observed in mice fed a high-vitamin A diet. Adipocyte cell culture revealed that endogenous and synthetic retinoic acid receptor (RAR)α- and RARγ-selective agonists, as well as a synthetic retinoid X receptor agonist, efficiently reduced adiponectin expression, whereas ALDH1A1 expression only increased with RAR agonists.', 'output': 'entailment', 'text_length': 1649, '__index_level_0__': 42157}\n",

The liver is the central organ in growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH-IGF) axis. Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can lead to liver problems. Although proinflammatory cytokines are an integral part of inflammation in chronic liver diseases, their involvement in mediating hepatic GH resistance during HCV infection remains to be elucidated. To address this issue, our study aimed at evaluating the influence of HCV infection on serum profile of IGF-1, TNF-alpha and IL-6 to assess their possible relation to hepatic dysfunction and GH resistance development. Twenty-five chronic HCV patients were studied together with 15 healthy control subjects. Serum concentration of IGF-1, TNF-alpha and IL-6 was determined by ELISA. HCV viral load was assessed by Real-time polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan probe technology. Basal serum GH levels were determined by a chemiluminescence assay and serum aminotransferases' activities were also measured. TNF-alpha and IL-6 demonstrated higher serum levels, while IGF-1 levels were significantly lower in HCV patients compared to healthy controls. A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between GH and IL-6 levels (P<0.05), a similar trend was found between GH levels, GH/IGF-1 ratio and AST/ALT ratio (P<0.01, P<0.01, respectively). A significant negative correlation was observed between HCV viral load and GH levels (P<0.05). The progressive increase in HCV viral load matches the decrease in circulating IGF-1 levels but without reaching statistical significance.\", 'output': 'entailment', 'text_length': 2134, '__index_level_0__': 42050}\n",

Currently, however, this risk is deemed to be low and guidelines have moved towards the continuation of metformin. We hypothesized that continuing metformin peri-operatively would lower postoperative serum glucose level without an effect on plasma lactate levels. We performed a single-blind multicentre randomized controlled trial in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus scheduled for non-cardiac surgery and continued (MF+ group) or withheld (MF- group) metformin before surgery. The main outcome measures were the differences in peri-operative plasma glucose and lactate levels. We randomized 70 patients (37 MF+ group and 33 MF- group) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Postoperative glucose levels were similar in the MF+ and the MF- groups (8.2\\u2009±\\u20091.8 vs 8.3\\u2009±\\u20092.3\\u2009mmol/L P\\u2009=\\u2009.95) Although preoperative lactate levels were slightly higher in the MF+ group compared with the MF- group (1.5 vs 1.2\\u2009mmol/L; P\\u2009=\\u2009.02), the postoperative lactate levels were not significantly different (1.2 vs 1.0\\u2009mmol/L; P\\u2009=\\u2009.18).', 'output': 'entailment', 'text_length': 1610, '__index_level_0__': 42124}\n",

On d 15, intestinal protein synthesis and lactase processing were measured in vivo in fed pigs using a 6-h intravenous, overlapping infusion of multiple stable isotopes (2H(3)-Leu, 13C(1)-Leu, 13C(1)-Phe, 2H(5)-Phe, 13C(6)-Phe and 13C(9)-Phe). Morphometry and cell proliferation also were measured in the jejunum and ileum. Neither dose of IGF-I affected the masses of wet tissue, protein or DNA, or the villus height, cell proliferation or LPH-specific activity. Oral IGF-I decreased the synthesis and abundance of prolactase-phlorizin hydrolase (pro-LPH), but increased brush-border (BB)-LPH synthesis in the ileum. The BB-LPH processing efficiency was twofold to threefold greater in IGF-fed than in control pigs. In all pigs, villus height and the total mucosal and specific activity of LPH activity were greater in the ileum than in the jejunum, yet the synthesis of BB-LPH were significantly lower in the ileum than in the jejunum.\", 'output': 'contradiction', 'text_length': 1744, '__index_level_0__': 42179}\n",

The established method of cytochrome C reduction by superoxide was modified to measure superoxide production in vascular rings from rabbit aortae. The diabetogenic compound alloxan significantly increased superoxide production in a concentration-dependent manner. The nitrovasodilators nitroprusside and minoxidil exhibited contrasting effects. Nitroprusside inhibited alloxan-stimulated production of superoxide, but minoxidil had no effect, suggesting different mechanisms of action for these drugs. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had no effect on the production of superoxide stimulated by alloxan, demonstrating that superoxide production induced by this compound is not affected by mechanisms involving cyclooxygenase. These data demonstrate the use of a simple, rapid and inexpensive method for measuring superoxide produced by intact vessels. This may be useful in testing drugs exhibiting antioxidant and vasoactive properties.', 'output': 'contradiction', 'text_length': 1654, '__index_level_0__': 42038}\n"
