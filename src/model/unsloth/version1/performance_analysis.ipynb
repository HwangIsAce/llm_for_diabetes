Before I am able to help you in this regard, I would like to have the following additional information: What was the location of the original and recent bumps? Specifically, were they on the upper side of the toe near the hairy area or over the soles? What has been the duration of the first bump? Can you post a photograph of the same? In case the bumps are on the upper side of the toe, in particular, if they seem to be arising from or near the hair follicles, then they could indicate furuncles, which are deep-seated infections of the hair follicle and though they can arise in healthy individuals, they are a little more common in diabetics. They are painful, warm and become hard, but often show a visible yellowish pus point. In that case, we would have to suggest a short course of oral antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines and suggest an antibiotic cream. In case they are on the sole i.e. undersurface of the toes, then they could be corns. But corns typically are of long duration, appear over pressure prone areas of the toe and do not subside on their own. They also hurt on walking. They can be treated medically as well as surgically.

Over ten million people worldwide suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy. This severe condition requires novel treatment approaches. Both oxidative and nitrosative stress are thought to have a role in the etiology of epilepsy. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that is used to treat type-2 diabetes mellitus. According to recent studies, Liraglutide also shows neuroprotective properties, improving memory retention and total hippocampus pyramidal neuronal population in mice. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the anti-seizure and anti-oxidative effects of liraglutide in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced rat model of epilepsy. 48 rats were randomly assigned to two groups those who had electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and those who underwent behavioral assessment. Rats received either intraperitoneal (IP) liraglutide at two different dosages (3-6 mgkg) or a placebo, followed by pentylenetetrazole (IP). To determine if liraglutide has anti-seizure characteristics, we examined seizure activity in rats using EEG, the Racine convulsion scale (RCS), the time of first myoclonic jerk (FMJ), and MDA, SOD, TNF-α, IL-1β and GAD-67 levels. The mean EEG spike wave percentage score was reduced from 75.8% (placebo) to 59.4% (lower-dose) and 41.5% (higher-dose). FMJ had increased from a mean of 70.6 s (placebo) to 181.2 s (lower-dose) and 205.2 s (higher-dose). RCS was reduced from a mean of 5.5 (placebo) to 2.7 (lower-dose) and 2.4 (higher-dose). Liraglutide (3 and 6 mgkg i.p.) successfully decreased the spike percentages and RCS associated with PTZ induced epilepsy, as well as considerably decreased MDA, TNF-α, IL-1β and elevated SOD, GAD-67 levels in rat brain. Liraglutide significantly decreased seizure activity at both dosages when compared to control, most likely due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The potential clinical role of liraglutide as an anti-seizure medication should be further explored.', 'output': 'The Anti-Seizure Effect of Liraglutide on Ptz-Induced Convulsions Through its Anti-Oxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Properties.', 'text_length': 2410, '__index_level_0__': 27365}\n",

Impaired fasting glucose is a marker of heightened risk for developing type 2 diabetes among perinatally HIV-infected individuals. Therefore, identifying individuals at this stage is crucial to enable early intervention. Therefore, we assessed impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and associated factors among perinatally HIV-infected population in Dar es salaam Tanzania. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 152 adolescents and youth attending HIV clinic at Muhimbili National Hospital and Infectious Disease Centre from July to August 2020. Fasting blood glucose (>8 hours) was measured using Of the 152 participants, the majority were male (n8354.6%), and the median age was 15(14-18) years. Overweight or obesity was prevalent in 16.4%, while more than one in ten (13.2%) had high blood pressure (≥14990mmHg). All participants were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) 46% had used medication for over ten years, and about one in three had poor medication adherence. Among the recruited participants, 29% had impaired fasting glucose. The odds of IFG were two times higher in males compared to females (PR, 2.07, 95% CI 1.19 -3.59 p0.001). Moreover, we found with every increase of Interleukin 6 biomarker there was a 1.01 probability increase of impaired fasting glucose (PR, 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 - 1.02 p0.003). About one in three perinatally HIV-infected youths had impaired fasting glucose in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, with males bearing the biggest brunt.

Emerging data implicate environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals as contributors to the obesity and diabetes epidemics. Previous studies have shown that the phenylsulfamide fungicide tolylfluanid (TF) augments glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent luciferase expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes while modulating insulin action in primary murine and human adipocytes. Studies were performed to interrogate glucocorticoid signaling in primary adipocytes exposed to TF. TF mimicked the gene transcription profile of the murine glucocorticoid corticosterone (Cort). Cellular fractionation assays demonstrated that TF treatment promoted the activating serine phosphorylation of GR, augmenting its cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation as well as its enrichment at glucocorticoid response elements on the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper gene promoter. After acute treatment, Cort or TF promoted insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) gene and protein expression. Either treatment also enriched GR binding at an identified glucocorticoid response element in the IRS-1 gene. TF or Cort each increased insulin-stimulated lipogenesis, an effect resulting from increased lipogenic gene expression and enhanced insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase. The augmentation of insulin-stimulated lipogenesis was mediated through a specific enhancement of Akt phosphorylation at T308. These findings support modulation of IRS-1 levels as a mechanism for glucocorticoid-mediated changes in insulin action in primary adipocytes. Albeit with less affinity than Cort, in silico analysis suggests that TF can interact with the ligand binding pocket of GR. Collectively, these studies identify TF as a structurally unique environmental glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoid signaling may thus represent a novel pathway by which environmental toxicants promote the development of metabolic diseases.', 'output': 'tolylfluanid, acetyl-coenzyme A, Cort, serine, leucine, phenylsulfamide, corticosterone', 'text_length': 3405, '__index_level_0__': 27159}\n",

The aim of this study was to determine if dietary GI influences the development of hyperglycaemia in C57BL/6 mice to more closely reflect T2D. Male C57BL/6 mice (n=30) were randomly divided into 3 dietary groups consisting of either standard rodent chow (4.8\\xa0% fat, 20\\xa0% protein), or a high fat (HF) diet (21-23\\xa0% fat, 19\\xa0% protein) with low GI (15.4\\xa0% starch; HF-LG) or high GI (50.5\\xa0% dextrose; HF-HG) ad libitum for 10 weeks. Body weight, blood glucose, glucose tolerance, and circulating cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured for the duration of the study. We found that increasing the GI of a moderately HF diet induces severe hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance in C57BL/6 mice, reflective of criteria for diagnosis of T2D, whilst littermates consuming an equivalent low GI diet maintain glucose homeostasis. This study demonstrates the significant contribution of both dietary carbohydrate and fat composition in the aetiopathogenesis of T2D.', 'output': 'glucose, triglyceride, carbohydrate, dextrose, cholesterol', 'text_length': 2461, '__index_level_0__': 27177}\n",

Hence, GSK-3 has emerged as an attractive target molecule for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Therefore, this research focused on identification and characterization of a novel small-molecule GSK-3 inhibitor. Compound 1a, a structure based on 3-hydroxychromone bearing isothiazolidine-1,1-dione, was identified from chemical library as a highly potent GSK-3 inhibitor. An in vitro kinase assay utilizing a panel of kinases demonstrated that compound 1a strongly inhibits GSK-3β. The potential effects of compound 1a on the inactivation of GSK-3 were confirmed in human liver HepG2 and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. Stabilization of glycogen synthase and β-catenin, which are direct targets of GSK-3, by compound 1a was assessed in comparison with two other GSK-3 inhibitors: LiCl and SB-415286. In mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, compound 1a markedly blocked adipocyte differentiation. Consistently, intraperitoneal administration of compound 1a to diet-induced obese mice significantly ameliorated their key symptoms such as body weight gain, increased adiposity, dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis due to the marked reduction of whole-body lipid level. In vitro and in vivo effects were accompanied by upregulation of β-catenin stability and downregulation of the expression of several critical genes related to lipid metabolism. From these results, it can be concluded that compound 1a, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of GSK-3, has potential as a new class of therapeutic agent for obesity treatment.', 'output': 'LiCl, isothiazolidine-1,1-dione, 3-hydroxychromone, SB-415286', 'text_length': 3132, '__index_level_0__': 27146}\n"
