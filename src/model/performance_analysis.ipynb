This study was conducted to establish a less painful method of blood sampling for monitoring of blood glucose concentrations. Fourteen healthy doctors and nurses at the age of 22 to 32 years were enrolled into this study. The earlobe was divided into 20 areas. Each area was punctured with a fine needle and the pain was assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS).

Context: Trichoderma reesei is an organism involved in degradation of (hemi)cellulosic biomass. Consequently, the corresponding enzymes are commonly used in different types of industries, and recently gained considerable importance for production of second-generation biofuel. Many industrial T. reesei strains currently in use are derived from strain Rut-C30, in which cellulase and hemicellulase expression is released from carbon catabolite repression. Nevertheless, inducing substances are still necessary for a satisfactory amount of protein formation. Here, we report on a T. reesei strain, which exhibits a very high level of xylanase expression regardless if inducing substances (e.g. D-xylose, xylobiose) are used. We found that a single point mutation in the gene encoding the Xylanase regulator 1 (Xyr1) is responsible for this strong deregulation of endo-xylanase expression and, moreover, a highly elevated basal level of cellulase expression. This point mutation is localized in a domain that is common in binuclear zinc cluster transcription factors. Only the use of sophorose as inducer still leads to a slight induction of cellulase expression. Under all tested conditions, the formation of cbh1 and cbh2 transcript level strictly follows the transcript levels of xyr1.

Context: Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, an autosomal dominant disorder, is mostly caused by mutations in the genes that encode AVP or its intracellular binding protein, neurophysin-II. The mutations lead to aberrant preprohormone processing and progressive destruction of AVP-secreting cells, which gradually manifests a progressive polyuria and polydipsia during early childhood, and a disorder of water homeostasis. We characterized the clinical and biochemical features, and sequenced the AVP neurophysin-II(AVP-NPII) gene of the affected individuals with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus(ADNDI)to determine whether this disease was genetically determined. We obtained the histories of eight affected and four unaffected family individuals. The diagnosis of ADNDI was established using a water deprivation test and exogenous AVP administration. For molecular analysis, genomic DNA was extracted and the AVP-NPII gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The eight affected individuals showed different spectra of age of onsets (7-15 years) and urine volumes (132-253 ml/kg/24 h). All affected individuals responded to vasopressin administration, with a resolution of symptoms and an increase in urine osmolality by more than 50%.

Context: Our aim was to establish a rat model of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) induced by macrophages and investigate whether macrophages can be a cell origin of fibroblast-like cells present in PVR. One eye of each rat received an intravitreal injection of macrophages. Clinical examination was performed to evaluate the development of PVR. Histological study was carried out to observe the pathological progression. Immunohistochemical staining with vimentin (VIM), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), α-smooth-muscle actin (α-SM actin), cytokeratin (CK) and CD68 characterized the cell types within the PVR membranes. The distribution, morphological change of prelabeled macrophages, as well as their colocalization with CD68, VIM, GFAP, α-SM actin and CK, were observed on days 3, 14 and 28 after injection. In response to intravitreal injection of macrophages, 90% of the experimental rats developed PVR from postoperative day 7. The histological progression of PVR was characterized by the sequential appearance of inflammatory cell invasion, fibroblast proliferation and scar formation. The dominating cells comprising the proliferative membranes at the advanced stage were fibroblasts. Injected macrophages retained round shape and positive staining with CD68 on day 3. On day 28, they acquired elongated/spindle shape combined with intense staining of VIM but absence of CD68, GFAP, α-SM actin and CK, and became the primary constituent of fibrocellular membranes.',\n",

Context: Renal hyperfiltration is a common abnormality associated with diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). In animal models, increased proximal tubular sodium reabsorption results in decreased distal sodium delivery, tubuloglomerular feedback activation, afferent vasodilatation, and hyperfiltration. The role of tubular factors is less well understood in humans. The aim of the current study was therefore to compare the fractional sodium excretion (FENa) in hyperfiltering (T1D-H) versus normofiltering (T1D-N) patients and healthy control (HC) subjects, as well as the role of ambient hyperglycemia on FENa. Blood pressure, renal function (inulin for glomerular filtration rate [GFR], and paraaminohippurate for effective renal plasma flow), FENa, and circulating neurohormones were measured in T1D-H (n = 28, GFR ≥135 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), T1D-N (n = 30), and HC (n = 35) subjects during clamped euglycemia.

Context: Radial augmentation index (rAI), a marker of aortic wave reflection, is usually lower in patients with diabetes (DM) than in non-DM subjects, even though atherosclerotic change is advanced in DM. We sought to explore why rAI in DM is lower than in non-DM. We performed radial applanation tonometry in 1787 subjects who had at least one cardiovascular risk factor. The rAI was defined as [late systolic shoulder pressure amplitude (PP2)]/[radial pulse pressure (rPP)]. The late systolic shoulder blood pressure (SBP2) and PP2 of a radial pressure wave were used as estimates of the central SBP and PP (cPP), respectively.

Context: The prevalence of births worldwide complicated by diabetes mellitus is increasing. In the UK, for example, <25% of diabetic women have a non-instrumental vaginal delivery. Strikingly, more than half the Caesarean sections (CS) in these patients are non-elective, but the reasons for this are not understood. We have tested the hypothesis that poor myometrial contractility as a consequence of the disease contributes to this high CS rate. We compared spontaneous, high K depolarisation and oxytocin-induced contractions from diabetic and matched control patients having an elective CS. To investigate the mechanism of any differences we measured intracellular Ca, and performed western blotting and compared the tissues histologically. There was significantly decreased contraction amplitude and duration in uteri from diabetic compared with control patients, even when possible confounders such as BMI were analysed. Reduced intracellular calcium signals and expression of calcium entry channels were found in uteruses from diabetic patients, which, along with a reduction in muscle content found on histological examination, could explain the reduced force.

To explore the mechanism of action through which BDNF regulates glucose metabolism, we examined the effects of BDNF on glucose utilization and norepinephrine (NE) content in peripheral tissues of diabetic mice. [(14)C]2-deoxyglucose ([(14)C]2-DG) uptake into peripheral tissues was analysed after intravenous injection of [(14)C]2-DG in db/db and normal C57BL/6 mice, and [(14)C]2-DG uptake and NE content in peripheral tissues were analysed after subcutaneous administration of BDNF (20 mg/kg) to male db/db and normal mice for 8 days. [(14)C]2-DG uptake in the diaphragm, heart, gastrocnemius, soleus and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) of db/db mice was significantly lower than in normal mice. Repetitive administration of BDNF to db/db mice for 8 days enhanced [(14)C]2-DG uptake in the diaphragm, heart, soleus, BAT and liver.

Context: The expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene, is associated with the emergence of the MDR phenotype in cancer cells. We investigated whether metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) down-regulates MDR1 expression in MCF-7/adriamycin (MCF-7/adr) cells. MCF-7 and MCF-7/adr cells were incubated with metformin and changes in P-gp expression were determined at the mRNA, protein and functional level. Transient transfection assays were performed to assess its gene promoter activities, and immunoblot analysis to study its molecular mechanisms of action. Metformin significantly inhibited MDR1 expression by blocking MDR1 gene transcription. Metformin also significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent P-gp substrate rhodamine-123. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity and the level of IκB degradation were reduced by metformin treatment. Moreover, transduction of MCF-7/adr cells with the p65 subunit of NF-κB induced MDR1 promoter activity and expression, and this effect was attenuated by metformin. The suppression of MDR1 promoter activity and protein expression was mediated through metformin-induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

Context: Increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers, especially C-reactive protein (CRP), are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and sudden cardiac death. Medical interventions that increase CRP levels, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in post-menopausal women, are under increasing scrutiny. The effect of HRT on CRP levels in women with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is not well documented, and conflicting conclusions have been reported. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of HRT on women with diabetes in a large cross-sectional study. Three hundred and twenty-seven post-menopausal women with T2DM from the Diabetes Heart Study participated. Current use of HRT was determined and serum CRP levels were measured using a high-sensitivity ELISA kit. Generalized estimating equation methods were used to assess the relationship of multiple clinical and lifestyle (e.g. smoking) measures on CRP levels including differences between women taking HRT (HRT+) and not taking HRT (HRT-). Overall serum CRP levels were strongly associated with body mass index (P < 0.0001) and age (P < 0.0001). Of the women, 243 were not using HRT and 84 were using HRT. HRT+ and HRT- women did not differ significantly in measures of clinical traits, with the exception of higher mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in HRT- women (P = 0.004).

Context: In a previous study we observed that acute administration of the selective antagonist of vasopressin (AVP) V2 receptors, SR 121463A (SR), aggravated the symptoms of diabetes insipidus (DI) in homozygous Brattleboro rats (an AVP-deficient strain). The present study investigates in more details the acute and chronic effects of SR in DI rats. In experiment A, different groups of rats received acute i.p. injections of SR (0.001-10 mg/kg) or vehicle alone, and urine was collected for the next 24 h. SR dose-dependently increased urine flow rate and decreased urine osmolality with no significant change in solute excretion, thus confirming a pure 'aquaretic' effect. In experiments B and C, the chronic effects of orally administered SR were evaluated over 8 days in Brattleboro DI rats (experiment B, 1 mg/kg/day) and in adult Sprague-Dawley rats with normal AVP secretion (experiment C, 3 mg/kg/day). In DI rats, the aquaretic effects of SR persisted with the same intensity over the 8 days. In Sprague-Dawley rats, SR induced a sustained, stable aquaretic effect and also increased non-renal water losses, suggesting an effect of AVP on water conservation in extrarenal sites. Because oxytocin (OT) synthesis is elevated in DI rats and OT is known to bind to V2 receptors, we evaluated the antidiuretic effects of OT in DI rats in experiment D. Chronic infusion of OT (3 microg/kg/h, i.p.) induced a marked antidiuresis, and acute SR (1 mg/kg) in OT-treated DI rats completely abolished this antidiuretic effect, thus indicating that it was due to binding of OT to V2 receptors.\",\n",
       "  'output': '(i) SR is a potent orally active aquaretic and induces stable effects during 1 week in rats with or without endogenous AVP secretion. (ii) Significant V2 receptor-mediated water reabsorption occurs in collecting ducts of Brattleboro DI rats because their usual urine osmolality is about twofold higher than the minimum observed during SR-induced maximum diuresis. (iii) This V2 agonism could be mediated in part by OT binding to V2 receptors. Small amounts of endogenous AVP, known to be produced by adrenal and testis in DI rats, could also contribute to this V2 agonism, as well as a possible constitutive activation of the V2 receptors. (iv) In normal rats, AVP probably reduces water losses through extrarenal sites, probably the lungs.',\n",

In contrast, SR induced a stable aquaretic effect and also increased non-renal water losses in Sprague-Dawley rats. Finally, we observed that OT induced a marked antidiuresis in DI rats, and acute SR completely abolished this antidiuretic effect.

We conducted a single-center 7-year historical cohort study in 200 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy. Study outcomes were clinical remission defined as disappearance of urine abnormalities at two consecutive visits, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline defined as 30% GFR decrease from baseline and GFR slope during the follow-up.

This study was designed to investigate whether treatment with molecular hydrogen (H(2)), which can remedy damage in various organs via reducing oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, is beneficial to ouabain-induced AN in gerbils. AN model was made by local application of ouabain (1 mmol/L, 20 mL) to the round window membrane in male Mongolian gerbils.

Before and 7 d after ouabain application, the hearing status of the animals was evaluated using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) approach, the hear cell function was evaluated with distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Seven days after ouabain application, the changes in the cochleae, especially the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), were morphologically studied. TUNEL staining and immunofluorescent staining for activated caspase-3 were used to assess the apoptosis of SGNs. Treatment with H(2) (2% and 4%) markedly attenuated the click and tone burst-evoked ABR threshold shift at 4, 8, and 16 kHz in ouabain-exposed animals. Neither local ouabain application, nor H(2) treatment changed the amplitude of DPOAE at 4, 8, and 16 kHz.

This prompted us to test whether the protease contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes using mouse models with CatS inactivation. CatS knockout mice and wild-type mice treated with orally active small-molecule CatS inhibitors were fed chow or high-fat diets and explored for change in glycaemic status. CatS deletion induced a robust reduction in blood glucose, which was preserved in diet-induced obesity and with ageing and was recapitulated with CatS inhibition in obese mice. In vivo testing of glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and glycaemic response to gluconeogenic substrates revealed that CatS suppression reduced hepatic glucose production despite there being no improvement in insulin sensitivity.

Context: Severe hypertrophy and heart failure are important risk factors in cardiac surgery. Early adaptive changes in hypertrophy include increased ventricular mass-to-cavity volume ratio (M/V ratio) and increased dependence on glucose for energy metabolism. However, glucose uptake is decreased in the late stages of hypertrophy when ventricular dilatation and failure are present. We hypothesized that impaired glucose uptake would be evident early in the progression of hypertrophy and associated with the onset of ventricular dilatation. Ten-day-old rabbits underwent banding of the descending aorta. Development of hypertrophy was followed by transthoracic echocardiography to measure left ventricular M/V ratio. Glucose uptake rate, as determined by (31)P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measuring 2-deoxyglucose conversion to 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate, was measured in isolated perfused hearts obtained from banded rabbits when M/V ratio had increased by 15% from baseline (compensated hypertrophy) and by 30% from baseline (early-decompensated hypertrophy). In age-matched control animals, the rate of glucose uptake was 0.61+/-0.08 micromol x g of wet weight(-1) x 30 min(-1) (mean+/-SEM). With a 15% M/V ratio increase, glucose uptake rate remained at control levels (0.6+/-0.05 micromol x g of wet weight(-1) x 30 min(-1)), compared with hearts with 30% increased M/V ratios, where glucose uptake was significantly lower (0.42+/-0.05 micromol x g of wet weight(-1) x 30 min(-1); P</=0.05). Glucose transporter protein expression was the same in all groups.',\n",
       "  'output': 'Glucose uptake rate is maintained during compensated hypertrophy. However, coinciding with severe hypertrophy, preceding ventricular dilatation, and glucose transporter protein downregulation, glucose uptake is significantly decreased. Because of the increased dependence of the hypertrophied hearts on glucose use, we speculate that this impairment may be a contributing factor in the progression to failure.',\n",

Context: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) improves glucose and lipid metabolism, but high circulating levels are found in type 2 diabetes, suggesting FGF21 resistance. Serum FGF21 predicts incident diabetes, but its performance compared to established and emerging predictors is not known. We aimed to study the performance of FGF21 in diabetes prediction, relative to other adipokines and established risk factors including 2-h plasma glucose (2hG) during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). We studied 1380 nondiabetic subjects from the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study using the second visit (2000-2004) as baseline when serum levels of FGF21 and other adipokines were measured. Glycaemic status was assessed by OGTT. Incident diabetes was defined as fasting glucose level (FG) ≥ 7 mmol/l or 2hG ≥ 11·1 mmol/l or use of antidiabetic agents, at subsequent visits. A total of 123 participants developed diabetes over 9·0 years (median). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, FGF21 (P = 0·003), adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (P = 0·003) and adiponectin (P = 0·035) were independent predictors of incident diabetes. FGF21 had the best change in log likelihood when added to a diabetes prediction model (DP) based on age, family history, smoking, hypertension, BMI, dyslipidaemia and FG. It also improved the area under ROC curve (AUROC) of diabetes prediction (DP) from 0·797 to 0·819 (P = 0·0072), rendering its performance comparable to the 'DP + 2hG' model (AUROC=0·838, P = 0·19).\",\n",

       "  'input': '[PRE] Hyperglycemia is implicated to play a major role in development of diabetic neuropathy. Since most of the diabetics are hyperglycemic much before they develop full-blown diabetes, we felt, it would be very important to know the effects of acute hyperglycemia on nerve function so that early pathophysiological events could be understood and appropriate therapeutic intervention can be made. Moreover, effect of acute hyperglycemia on motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and nerve blood flow (NBF) is not known. Hence, we studied the effects of acute hyperglycemia on sciatic MNCV and sciatic NBF in healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Three different animal models of acute hyperglycemia (50% glucose (3 g kg(-1), i.v. (intra-venous) or i.p. (intra-peritoneally)) or 24 h post-streptozotocin (STZ) injected rats were used. Acute hyperglycemia but not mannitol or sucrose significantly attenuated MNCV and NBF. Adenosine (10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) prevented the acute hyperglycemia-induced attenuation of MNCV and NBF in all the three rat models of acute hyperglycemia. Adenosine effects were blocked by theophylline (50 mg kg(-1), i.p.) suggesting the role of adenosinergic receptor mediated mechanisms in acute hyperglycemia-induced neuropathy. Acute glucose administration in 8 weeks, STZ diabetic rats did not further affect MNCV or NBF. Adenosine (10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) did not produce any adverse effects on the blood pressure and heart rate.',\n",

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs CRP), and proinsulin levels were measured at baseline and after 12 wk of therapy. Micronized fenofibrate significantly reduced serum triglyceride, cholesterol, and uric acid levels (all p <0.0001) and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (p <0.001) and creatinine levels (p <0.0001).

       "  'input': '[PRE] Renal tubular epithelial cell (RTC) apoptosis causes tubular atrophy, a hallmark of renal disease progression. Apoptosis is generally characterized by reduced cell volume and cytosolic pH, but epithelial cells are relatively resistant to shrinkage due to regulatory volume increase, which is mediated by Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) 1. We investigated whether RTC apoptosis requires caspase cleavage of NHE1. Staurosporine- and hypertonic NaCl-induced RTC apoptosis was associated with cell shrinkage and diminished cytosolic pH, and apoptosis was potentiated by amiloride analogs, suggesting NHE1 activity opposes apoptosis. NHE1-deficient fibroblasts demonstrated increased susceptibility to apoptosis, which was reversed by NHE1 reconstitution. NHE1 expression was markedly decreased in apoptotic RTC due to degradation, and preincubation with peptide caspase antagonists restored NHE1 expression, indicating that NHE1 is degraded by caspases. Recombinant caspase-3 cleaved the in vitro-translated NHE1 cytoplasmic domain into five distinct peptides, identical in molecular weight to NHE1 degradation products derived from staurosporine-stimulated RTC lysates. In vivo, NHE1 loss-of-function C57BL/6.SJL-swe/swe mice with adriamycin-induced nephropathy demonstrated increased RTC apoptosis compared with adriamycin-treated wild-type controls, thereby implicating NHE1 inactivation as a potential mechanism of tubular atrophy.',\n",

       "  'input': '[PRE] ET (endothelin)-1, a potent vasoconstrictor peptide released by the endothelium, plays an important role in vasomotor regulation and has been linked to diminished endothelial vasodilator capacity in several pathologies associated with human aging, including hypertension, Type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. However, it is currently unknown whether the decline in endothelial vasodilatation with advancing age is due to elevated ET-1 vasoconstrictor activity. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that the age-related impairment in ACh (acetylcholine)-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilatation is due, at least in part, to increased ET-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone. FBF (forearm blood flow) responses to ACh, SNP (sodium nitroprusside) and BQ-123 (ET(A) receptor blocker) were determined in 14 young (age, 25 ± 1 years) and 14 older (age, 61 ± 2 years) healthy non-obese men. Additionally, FBF responses to ACh were determined in the presence of ETA blockade. Vasodilatation to ACh was lower (approx. 25%; P<0.05) in the older men (from 4.9 ± 0.2 to 13.9 ± 0.9 ml·100 ml(-1) of tissue·min(-1)) compared with the young men (4.6 ± 0.3 to 17.2 ± 1.0 ml·100 ml(-1) of tissue·min(-1)). There were no differences in FBF responses to SNP between the young (4.8 ± 0.3 to 18.5 ± 0.3 ml·100 ml(-1) of tissue·min(-1)) and older (5.1 ± 0.3 to 17.3 ± 0.8 ml·100 ml(-1) of tissue·min(-1)) men. In the young men, resting FBF was not significantly altered by BQ-123, whereas, in the older men, FBF increased approx. 25% in response to BQ-123 infusion (P<0.05). Co-infusion of ACh with BQ-123 resulted in an approx. 20% increase in the ACh-induced vasodilatation in older men compared with saline. In contrast, FBF responses to ACh were not significantly altered by ET(A) blockade in the young men.',\n",

       "  'input': '[PRE] Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) has key roles in the regulation of adipogenesis, inflammation, and lipid and glucose metabolism. C-peptide is believed to be inert and without appreciable biological functions. Recent studies suggest that C-peptide possesses multiple functions. The present study investigated the effects of insulin and C-peptide on PPARgamma transcriptional activity in opossum kidney proximal tubular cells. Both insulin and C-peptide induced a concentration-dependent stimulation of PPARgamma transcriptional activity. Both agents substantially augmented thiazolidinedione-stimulated PPARgamma transcriptional activity. Neither insulin nor C-peptide had any effect on the expression levels of PPARgamma. GW9662, a PPARgamma antagonist, blocked PPARgamma activation by thiazolidinediones but had no effect on either insulin- or C-peptide-stimulated PPARgamma transcriptional activity. Co-transfection of opossum kidney cells with dominant negative mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase significantly depressed basal PPARgamma transcriptional activity but had no effect on that induced by either insulin or C-peptide. Both insulin- and C-peptide-stimulated PPARgamma transcriptional activity were attenuated by wortmannin and by expression of a dominant negative phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit. In addition PI 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of PPARgamma was observed after stimulation by C-peptide or insulin. C-peptide effects but not insulin on PPARgamma transcriptional activity were abolished by pertussis toxin pretreatment. Finally both C-peptide and insulin positively control the expression of the PPARgamma-regulated CD36 scavenger receptor in human THP-1 monocytes.',\n",

       "  'input': '[PRE] During lipid oversupply, the heart becomes insulin resistant, as exemplified by defective insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and will develop diastolic dysfunction. In the healthy heart, not only insulin, but also increased contractile activity stimulates glucose uptake. Upon increased contraction both AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase D (PKD) are activated, and mediate the stimulation of glucose uptake into cardiomyocytes. Therefore, each of these kinases is a potential therapeutic target in the diabetic heart because they may serve to bypass defective insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. To test the preventive potential of these kinases against loss of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, AMPK or PKD were adenovirally overexpressed in primary cultures of insulin resistant cardiomyocytes for assaying substrate uptake, insulin responsiveness and lipid accumulation. To induce insulin resistance and lipid loading, rat primary cardiomyocytes were cultured in the presence of high insulin (100 nM; HI) or high palmitate (palmitate/BSA: 3/1; HP). HI and HP each reduced insulin responsiveness, and increased basal palmitate uptake and lipid storage. Overexpression of each of the kinases prevented loss of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Overexpression of AMPK also prevented loss of insulin signaling in HI- and HP-cultured cardiomyocytes, but did not prevent lipid accumulation. In contrast, overexpression of PKD prevented lipid accumulation, but not loss of insulin signaling in HI- and HP-cultured cardiomyocytes.',\n",

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of chronic and selective pharmacological activation of PPARdelta in a model of congestive heart failure. PPARdelta-specific agonist treatment (GW610742X at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day for 6-9 weeks) was initiated immediately postmyocardial infarction (MI) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy was used to assess cardiac function and energetics. A 1-(13)C glucose clamp was performed to assess relative cardiac carbohydrate versus fat oxidation. Additionally, cardiac hemodynamics and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction gene expression analysis was performed. MI rats had significantly reduced left ventricle (LV) ejection fractions and whole heart phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate ratio compared with Sham animals (reduction of 43% and 14%, respectively). However, GW610742X treatment had no effect on either parameter. In contrast, the decrease in relative fat oxidation rate observed in both LV and right ventricle (RV) following MI (decrease of 58% and 54%, respectively) was normalized in a dose-dependent manner following treatment with GW610742X. These metabolic changes were associated with an increase in lipid transport/metabolism target gene expression (eg, CD36, CPT1, UCP3). Although there was no difference between groups in LV weight or infarct size measured upon necropsy, there was a dramatic reduction in RV hypertrophy and lung congestion (decrease of 22-48%, P<0.01) with treatment which was associated with a >7-fold decrease (P<0.05) in aterial natriuretic peptide gene expression in RV. Diuretic effects were not observed with GW610742X.',\n",

However, despite significant increases in these parameters when SMFA was administered with glucose, the effects on pH values were small and the survival rate was not changed. SMFA also increased the serum concentrations of free fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, ammonia, urea, and calcium. The presence of glucose enhanced or suppressed these metabolic changes.

Detailed reexamination of the spectrophotometric assay resulted in the observation that the fructose 2,6-bisphosphate-dependent inhibition was a function of the cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase and phosphofructokinase activities compared to the amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase used as auxiliary enzyme. The diminution or loss of the fructose 2,6-bisphosphate-dependent inhibition produced in aged cytosols was restored by addition of crystalline muscle phosphofructokinase, as well as by decreasing the amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the assay. When phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, and hexokinase activities were separated by DEAE-chromatography of liver cytosol, no fructose 2,6-bisphosphate-dependent inhibition of hexokinase was found in any single fraction of the chromatogram. However, combination of fractions containing both phosphoglucose isomerase and phosphofructokinase displayed the fructose 2,6-bisphosphate-dependent inhibition on either endogenous hexokinase or added yeast hexokinase.',\n",

We previously demonstrated that mice exposed to chronic IH develop elevated TG. We now hypothesize that a single exposure to acute hypoxia also increases TG due to the stimulation of free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization from white adipose tissue (WAT), resulting in increased hepatic TG synthesis and secretion. Male C57BL6/J mice were exposed to FiO(2) = 0.21, 0.17, 0.14, 0.10, or 0.07 for 6 h followed by assessment of plasma and liver TG, glucose, FFA, ketones, glycerol, and catecholamines. Hypoxia dose-dependently increased plasma TG, with levels peaking at FiO(2) = 0.07. Hepatic TG levels also increased with hypoxia, peaking at FiO(2) = 0.10. Plasma catecholamines also increased inversely with FiO(2). Plasma ketones, glycerol, and FFA levels were more variable, with different degrees of hypoxia inducing WAT lipolysis and ketosis. FiO(2) = 0.10 exposure stimulated WAT lipolysis but decreased the rate of hepatic TG secretion. This degree of hypoxia rapidly and reversibly delayed TG clearance while decreasing [(3)H]triolein-labeled Intralipid uptake in brown adipose tissue and WAT. Hypoxia decreased adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in brown adipose tissue and WAT. In addition, hypoxia decreased the transcription of LPL, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and fatty acid transporter CD36.',\n",

We find while FGF21 can lower body weight in both wild-type and Ucp1 knockout mice, rapid clearance of glucose by FGF21 is defective in the absence of UCP1.

E74-like ETS transcription factor 3 (ELF3) participates in endothelial inflammatory processes. We hypothesized that ELF3 modulates MARK4 expression in vascular endothelial cells, thus contributing to high glucose-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Plasma IL-1β, IL-18, NLRP3 inflammasome and MARK4 expression was increased in diabetic patients and rats. An in vitro study indicated that high glucose increased IL-1β and IL-18 expression and activated the NLRP3 inflammasome via upregulation of MARK4 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, high glucose increased ELF3 expression. ELF3 downregulation reversed the effects of high glucose treatment. Accordingly, the effects of ELF3 overexpression were similar to those of high glucose treatment and were counteracted by siMARK4. Furthermore, ELF3 was found to interact with SET8. High glucose inhibited SET8 expression and histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me1), a downstream target of SET8. Overexpression of SET8 inhibited high glucose-induced MARK4 expression and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The effects of shSET8 were similar to those of high glucose treatment and were counteracted by siMARK4. A mechanistic study found that ELF3 and H4K20me1 were enriched in the MARK4 promoter region. si-ELF3 attenuated MARK4 promoter activity and augmented the inhibitory effect of SET8 on MARK4 promoter activity.

Incorporation of 13C-labeled glucose (Glc) is necessary to allow glycogen measurement, but might be affected by turnover changes. Our aim was to measure glycogen absolute concentration in the rat brain by eliminating label turnover as variable. The approach is based on establishing an increased, constant 13C isotopic enrichment (IE). 13C-Glc infusion is then performed at the IE of brain glycogen. As glycogen IE cannot be assessed in vivo, we validated that it can be inferred from that of N-acetyl-aspartate IE in vivo: After [1-13C]-Glc ingestion, glycogen IE was 2.2 +/- 0.1 fold that of N-acetyl-aspartate (n = 11, R(2) = 0.77). After subsequent Glc infusion, glycogen IE equaled brain Glc IE (n = 6, paired t-test, p = 0.37), implying isotopic steady-state achievement and complete turnover of the glycogen molecule. Glycogen concentration measured in vivo by 13C NMR (mean +/- SD: 5.8 +/- 0.7 micromol/g) was in excellent agreement with that in vitro (6.4 +/- 0.6 micromol/g, n = 5). When insulin was administered, the stability of glycogen concentration was analogous to previous biochemical measurements implying that glycogen turnover is activated by insulin.',\n",

When exposed to high glucose (HG), retinal epithelial cells undergo profound alterations both morphologically and functionally in a well-conserved process known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mechanism governing HG-induced EMT in retinal epithelial cells is not completely understood. Here we report that treatment with 25\\u202fmM glucose led to EMT in retinal pigmented epithelial cells (RPE) characterized by a simultaneous down-regulation of E-Cadherin (encoded by CDH1) and up-regulation of alpha smooth muscle actin (encoded by ACTA2). HG-induced EMT in RPEs was accompanied by augmented expression and enhanced nuclear enrichment of MKL1, a transcriptional modulator. In contrast, MKL1 knockdown by siRNA or inhibition by CCG-1423 abrogated HG-induced EMT in RPEs. Of interest, MKL1 mediated the transcriptional activation of LOX, a mesenchymal marker, in RPEs in response to HG stimulation. Mechanistically, MKL1 interacted with and was recruited by AP-1 to the proximal LOX promoter to promote LOX trans-activation likely through altering the chromatin structure. Finally, LOX depletion by siRNA or inhibition by aminopropionitrile in RPEs abolished HG-induced EMT.',\n",

Infection with an adenovirus encoding the constitutively active nuclear fragment of SREBP1c resulted in expression of the protein in approx. 20% of islet cell nuclei, with a preference for beta-cells at the islet periphery. Real-time PCR (TaqMan) analysis showed that SREBP1c up-regulated the expression of FAS (fatty acid synthase; 6-fold), acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (2-fold), as well as peroxisomal-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (7-fold), uncoupling protein-2 (1.4-fold) and Bcl2 (B-cell lymphocytic-leukaemia proto-oncogene 2; 1.3-fold).

The protein expressions of apoptosis-related proteins such as Bcl-2 family, caspases, Fas, PARP, ERK1/2 and JNK were detected by western blot analysis. Moreover, the HCT116 cells were treated with UO126 and SP600125 inhibitors to verify the involvement of ERK1/2 and JNK protein expressions in inducing apoptotic cell death.

Activation of caspase cascades (caspase-3, -9, -8 and -10) was elicited followed by the observation of cleaved PARP accumulation in DBEAF-treated cells. Furthermore, death receptor, Fas was activated upon exposure to DBEAF. Collective apoptotic evidences suggested the involvement of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways by DBEAF in HCT116 cells.

       "  'input': '[PRE] Rat pituitary tumor cells (GC cells) exhibit spontaneous oscillations of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) that allow continuous release of growth hormone (GH). Of the somatostatin (SRIH) receptor subtypes (sst receptors) mediating SRIH action, sst(1) and sst(2) receptors are highly expressed by GC cell membranes. In the present study, the effects of sst(1) or sst(2) receptor activation on single-cell [Ca(2+)](i) were investigated in GC cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy. In addition, the effects of sst(1) or sst(2) receptor activation on GH secretion were also studied. Our results demonstrate that SRIH decreases [Ca(2+)](i) baseline and almost completely blocks Ca(2+) transients through activation of sst(2) but not of sst(1) receptors. In contrast, SRIH effectively inhibits GH secretion through activation of both sst(1) and sst(2) receptors. Blocking Ca(2+) transients is less efficient than SRIH to inhibit GH release. The cyclic octapeptide, CYN-154806, antagonizes sst(2) receptors at [Ca(2+)](i) since it abolishes the sst(2) receptor-mediated inhibition of [Ca(2+)](i) without affecting single-cell Ca(2+) signals. On the other hand, CYN-154806 alone potently inhibits GH secretion through the involvement of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins.',\n",

To explore the mechanism underlying this effect, we used 3T3-L1 adipocytes for analyzing the signaling pathways that contribute to glucose transport. Treatment of berberine to 3T3-L1 adipocytes for 6 h enhanced basal glucose uptake both in normal and in insulin-resistant state, but the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was not augmented significantly. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) by wortmannin did not affect the berberine effect on basal glucose uptake. Berberine did not augment tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1. Further, berberine had no effect on the activity of the insulin-sensitive downstream kinase, atypical protein kinase C (PKCzeta/lambda). However, interestingly, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), which have been known to be responsible for the expression of glucose transporter (GLUT)1, were significantly activated in berberine-treated 3T3-L1 cells. As expected, the level of GLUT1 protein was increased both in normal and insulin-resistant cells in response to berberine. But berberine affected the expression of GLUT4 neither in normal nor in insulin-resistant cells. In addition, berberine treatment increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in 3T3-L1 cells, which has been reported to be associated with GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake.',\n",

However, its effects on cellular bioenergetics have not been explored. We have previously reported that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR, an AMPK activator) enhances mitochondrial respiration through a succinate dehydrogenase (SDH or complex II)-dependent mechanism in cardiac myocytes, leading us to predict that Adiponectin would exert a similar effect via activating AMPK. Our results show that Adiponectin enhances basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity (SRC), which were all abolished by the knockdown of AMPKγ1, inhibition of SDH complex assembly, via the knockdown of the SDH assembly factor 1 (Sdhaf1), or inhibition of SDH activity. Additionally, Adiponectin alleviated hypoxia-induced reductions in OCR and ATP production, in a Sdhaf1-dependent manner, whereas overexpression of Sdhaf1 confirmed its sufficiency for mediating these effects. Importantly, the levels of holoenzyme SDH under the various conditions correlated with OCR. We also show that the effects of Adiponectin, AMPK, Sdhaf1, as well as, SDH complex assembly all required sirtuin 3 (Sirt3).',\n",

       "  'input': '[PRE] Fetal pancreatic beta cells demonstrate a deficient insulin release in response to glucose, but the underlying mechanism at the cellular level is unknown. By using beta cells from 21-day fetal rats we made an attempt to clarify the mechanism(s) behind this reduced glucose response. In addition to measuring insulin release, glucose metabolism, and cellular ATP content, ATP-regulated K+ channels (G channels) and voltage-activated Ca2+ currents were investigated with the patch-clamp technique. It was thus demonstrated that the ATP-regulated K+ channels in fetal beta cells were not sensitive to glucose but otherwise had similar characteristics as those of adult beta cells. Also, the characteristics of the voltage-activated Ca2+ currents were similar in adult and fetal beta cells. However, as judged from measurements of both glucose oxidation and glucose utilization, glucose metabolism was impaired in fetal beta cells. In addition, there was no increase in the ATP content, even when the cells were stimulated for 30 min.',\n",

       "  'input': '[PRE] An increased oxidative stress may contribute to the development of diabetic nephropathy. We have recently reported that high glucose level stimulated superoxide production through protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent activation of NAD(P)H oxidase in cultured vascular cells. Here we show that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) attenuates both high glucose level-induced and angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated kinase (MAP kinase) in cultured human mesangial cells through inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase activity. The intracellular oxidative stress in cultured mesangial cells was evaluated by electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement. MAP kinase activity was evaluated by western blot analysis using anti phospho-specific MAP kinase antibody and anti-ERK-1 antibody. Exposure of the cells to high glucose level (450 mg/dl) for 72 hrs significantly increased MAP kinase activity as compared to normal glucose level (100 mg/dl). This increase was completely blocked by the treatment of pitavastatin (5x10(-7) M) as well as a NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor (diphenylene iodonium, 10(-5) M) in parallel with the attenuation of oxidative stress. Ang II-induced activation of MAP kinase was also completely blocked by pitavastatin as well as a diphenylene iodonium in parallel with the attenuation of oxidative stress.',\n",

       "  'input': '[PRE] Historically, metformin was withheld before surgery for fear of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Currently, however, this risk is deemed to be low and guidelines have moved towards the continuation of metformin. We hypothesized that continuing metformin peri-operatively would lower postoperative serum glucose level without an effect on plasma lactate levels. We performed a single-blind multicentre randomized controlled trial in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus scheduled for non-cardiac surgery and continued (MF+ group) or withheld (MF- group) metformin before surgery. The main outcome measures were the differences in peri-operative plasma glucose and lactate levels. We randomized 70 patients (37 MF+ group and 33 MF- group) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Postoperative glucose levels were similar in the MF+ and the MF- groups (8.2\\u2009±\\u20091.8 vs 8.3\\u2009±\\u20092.3\\u2009mmol/L P\\u2009=\\u2009.95) Although preoperative lactate levels were slightly higher in the MF+ group compared with the MF- group (1.5 vs 1.2\\u2009mmol/L; P\\u2009=\\u2009.02), the postoperative lactate levels were not significantly different (1.2 vs 1.0\\u2009mmol/L; P\\u2009=\\u2009.18).',\n",

controlled study for mrsa nosocomial pneumonia , lzd showed better clinical efficacy and microbiological responses than vancomycin . \\n rayner et al .   reported that higher success rates for lzd may occur at auc24/mic values of 80120 for bacteremia , skin and skin structure infections , and lower respiratory tract infections . \\n in this case , on day  50 , the urine culture developed mrsa 10/colony -

controlled study for mrsa nosocomial pneumonia, lzd showed better clinical efficacy and microbiological responses than vancomycin. \\n rayner et al.   reported that higher success rates for lzd may occur at auc24/mic values of 80120 for bacteremia, skin and skin structure infections, and lower respiratory tract infections. \\n in this case, on day  50, the urine culture developed mrsa 10/colony - forming units / ml. it is unclear whether the patient had a urinary tract infection or if the observed mrsa in the urine had simply passed into the urine from the blood. \\n additionally, on day  64, mrsa was not detected in the urine culture. to the best of our knowledge \\n, little investigation has been conducted into the usefulness of lzd for the treatment of urinary tract infections. \\n approximately 35% of lzd is excreted in urine. in this case, a high level of urine output was observed because of di and, consequently, the high doses of lzd may be passed though the urinary tract. therefore, despite low plasma lzd auc, the urine culture may become negative. \\n interestingly, in spite of the remarkably low level of the auc24/mic in this case, mrsa pneumonia bacteremia was treated successfully after lzd administration. in lzd, the level of plasma protein binding is 31% and the volume of distribution approximates the total water content of the body ( 4050  l ) [ 15, 16 ]. in lung tissues, it was reported that lzd concentrations in the epithelial lining fluid ( 64.3    33.1  g / ml ) were much higher than those in the blood ( 7.3    4.9  g / ml ) and alveolar cells ( 2.2    0.6  g / ml ). \\n these findings suggest that lzd is excluded or rapidly removed from the blood to the lung compartment. as this was a retrospective study \\n for this reason we could not take cultures and blood samples every day. to our knowledge, this is the first report showing the successful treatment of mrsa pneumonia with bacteremia despite very low lzd auc24/mic. \\n localized higher concentrations of lzd in the lung might have been sufficiently effective in treating the pneumonia and the secondary bacteremia as a result of the sites of these infections ; however, the precise mechanism of low lzd auc24/mic and successful treatment of mrsa infection in these cases remains generally unknown. \\n in conclusion, sub - therapeutic levels of lzd blood concentrations may be caused by uncontrolled di with high crcl and a high level of fluid administration. in spite of the low level of auc24/mic, mrsa pneumonia and bacteremia \\n were successfully treated with lzd. as this was a retrospective study, we were unable to evaluate the concentration of lzd on days  6068 after the 1-h lzd administration for the pk assessment. \\n we must further study the actual pk assessment of lzd in patients with high crcl caused by di. \\n further investigation is required into the mechanisms of low lzd auc24/mic and the successful treatment of these mrsa infections. \\n below is the link to the electronic supplementary material. \\n supplementary material 1 ( pdf 243  kb ) supplementary material 1 ( pdf 243  kb ) \\n yoshihiko nakamura, masanobu uchiyama, shuuji hara, mariko mizunuma, takafumi nakano, hiroyasu ishikura, kota hoshino, yasumasa kawano, and tohru takata have nothing to disclose. \\n informed consent was obtained from the patient s family in relation to his being included in the study. \\n this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution -

capillary network \\n in the lung33 , 34 moreover , it may attenuate reduced pulmonary elastic recoil . thus , \\n the decrease in hba1c may have improved the lung function of the subjects after the ase \\n training in this study . \\n it is known that normal lung mechanics and gas exchange are affected by the integrity of \\n pulmonary connective tissue and microvasculature . \\n abnormalities in either of these two \\n structural components of the lung may result in the development of pulmonary \\n dysfunction34 . in a previous report \\n , it \\n was reported that a 10% decrease in fev1 was related to a 12% increase in \\n all - cause mortality8 . \\n the measured airflow \\n limitation is expected to increase all - cause mortality in patients with diabetes . \\n rigorous \\n blood management may reduce the risk of death through improved ventilatory function \\n independent of other beneficial effects . the ase decreased obesity and increased the dynamic lung volumes . \\n the fact that a reduction \\n in body fat or obesity improved the pulmonary functions after the ase training in this study \\n is consistent with many previous studies investigating low - intensity exercise training in \\n patients with diabetes24 , patients with \\n metabolic syndrome20 , and obese \\n subjects35 . \\n moreover , miyatake , et \\n al.36 reported that reduction of body \\n fat by low - intensity exercise in obesity leads to increased lung elasticity , which is \\n reflected in improvements in fev1 , fvc , and mvv . \\n the presence of extensive \\n microvascular circulation and abundant connective tissue in the lungs raises the possibility \\n that lung tissue may be affected by a microangiopathy process and nonenzymatic glycosylation \\n of tissue proteins . \\n the decrease in body fat in this study may be due to increased fat oxidation during the \\n exercise . \\n although we did not measure fat oxidation during the exercise , previous studies \\n support this finding25 , 37 . \\n ( 2002 ) demonstrated that \\n low - intensity exercise contributed to increased fat oxidation during exercise in obese \\n subjects . \\n our previous study showed that fat was mostly used as an energy source during \\n low - intensity exercise compared with higher - intensity exercise in young lean thai \\n individuals25 . \\n the reason for this \\n result could be due to a lower rate of glycolysis resulting in lower malonyl coa production \\n from a low level of muscle contraction during low - intensity exercise . \\n malonyl coa inhibits \\n carnitine palmitoyl transferase ( cpt ) , which carries free fatty acid into mitochondria for \\n fat oxidation38 . therefore , with a lower \\n level of malonyl coa , more fat is taken up and oxidized during the exercise . \\n however , we did \\n not measure the amount of fat oxidation or the fat source that was used during the exercise . \\n instead , we used lipid profiles from routine clinical investigation to indicate the source \\n of fat in the blood stream during rest in this study , and it was found that it was unchanged \\n by the ase . \\n free fatty acids from either adipocytes or intramuscular triglycerides may be \\n the source of fat involved in the increased fat oxidation during exercise in this study . \\n thus , further research investigating fat oxidation and the fat source during the ase needs \\n to be performed . in summary , the present results indicate that the ase can be an alternative mode of \\n exercise to reduce pulmonary function impairment of t2 dm patients , especially pulmonary \\n function impairment . \\n this reduction of pulmonary function impairment as a result of the ase \\n may be due to the improvement of hyperglycemia and fat metabolism and the decrease in \\n percent body fat .',\n",

capillary network \\n in the lung33, 34 moreover, it may attenuate reduced pulmonary elastic recoil. thus, \\n the decrease in hba1c may have improved the lung function of the subjects after the ase \\n training in this study. \\n it is known that normal lung mechanics and gas exchange are affected by the integrity of \\n pulmonary connective tissue and microvasculature. \\n abnormalities in either of these two \\n structural components of the lung may result in the development of pulmonary \\n dysfunction34. in a previous report \\n, it \\n was reported that a 10% decrease in fev1 was related to a 12% increase in \\n all - cause mortality8. \\n the measured airflow \\n limitation is expected to increase all - cause mortality in patients with diabetes. \\n rigorous \\n blood management may reduce the risk of death through improved ventilatory function \\n independent of other beneficial effects. the ase decreased obesity and increased the dynamic lung volumes. \\n the fact that a reduction \\n in body fat or obesity improved the pulmonary functions after the ase training in this study \\n is consistent with many previous studies investigating low - intensity exercise training in \\n patients with diabetes24, patients with \\n metabolic syndrome20, and obese \\n subjects35. \\n moreover, miyatake, et \\n al.36 reported that reduction of body \\n fat by low - intensity exercise in obesity leads to increased lung elasticity, which is \\n reflected in improvements in fev1, fvc, and mvv. \\n the presence of extensive \\n microvascular circulation and abundant connective tissue in the lungs raises the possibility \\n that lung tissue may be affected by a microangiopathy process and nonenzymatic glycosylation \\n of tissue proteins. \\n the decrease in body fat in this study may be due to increased fat oxidation during the \\n exercise. \\n although we did not measure fat oxidation during the exercise, previous studies \\n support this finding25, 37. \\n ( 2002 ) demonstrated that \\n low - intensity exercise contributed to increased fat oxidation during exercise in obese \\n subjects. \\n our previous study showed that fat was mostly used as an energy source during \\n low - intensity exercise compared with higher - intensity exercise in young lean thai \\n individuals25. \\n the reason for this \\n result could be due to a lower rate of glycolysis resulting in lower malonyl coa production \\n from a low level of muscle contraction during low - intensity exercise. \\n malonyl coa inhibits \\n carnitine palmitoyl transferase ( cpt ), which carries free fatty acid into mitochondria for \\n fat oxidation38. therefore, with a lower \\n level of malonyl coa, more fat is taken up and oxidized during the exercise. \\n however, we did \\n not measure the amount of fat oxidation or the fat source that was used during the exercise. \\n instead, we used lipid profiles from routine clinical investigation to indicate the source \\n of fat in the blood stream during rest in this study, and it was found that it was unchanged \\n by the ase. \\n free fatty acids from either adipocytes or intramuscular triglycerides may be \\n the source of fat involved in the increased fat oxidation during exercise in this study. \\n thus, further research investigating fat oxidation and the fat source during the ase needs \\n to be performed. in summary, the present results indicate that the ase can be an alternative mode of \\n exercise to reduce pulmonary function impairment of t2 dm patients, especially pulmonary \\n function impairment. \\n this reduction of pulmonary function impairment as a result of the ase \\n may be due to the improvement of hyperglycemia and fat metabolism and the decrease in \\n percent body fat.'},\n",

therefore , early diagnosis is important . \\n pleural effusion , ascites , and/or cardiac effusion are the first symptoms to appear in more than half of patients with poems syndrome , and these conditions can become lifethreatening in some cases 2 . the criteria for poems syndrome vegf : vascular epithelial growth factor . due to the abovementioned unique manifestations of poems syndrome \\n , it can be difficult to achieve an early or accurate diagnosis in cases in which a patient with undiagnosed poems syndrome develops cancer . \\n in other words , pleural effusion , ascites , lymphadenopathy , and bone lesions caused by poems syndrome might be misdiagnosed as cancer metastases if the preexisting poems syndrome is not detected . \\n herein , we present the first case report of poems syndrome with synchronous breast cancer and describe potential diagnostic problems associated with such cases . \\n a 65yearold female with a chief complaint of coxalgia , which had lasted for 2 years , presented to a nearby hospital . \\n a computed tomography ( ct ) scan showed multiple sclerotic bone lesions , which were suggestive of an occult primary tumor and multiple bone metastases . despite extensive testing for 3 months \\n , no final diagnosis was made so the patient was referred to our hospital for a second opinion . by that time , she had developed further symptoms ; that is , a prolonged bloating sensation and visible abdominal distension , which had lasted for a month . \\n she received a thorough examination at our hospital 's internal medicine department , including various blood tests ; imaging examinations , such as ct and mammography ; upper and lower endoscopy ; and cytoscreening ( a biochemical examination ) of her ascites . \\n the differential diagnosis process particularly focused on autoimmune connective tissue disorders in addition to a further examination for occult primary cancer . \\n the patient 's laboratory data were indicative of anemia , thrombocytopenia , low serum albumin levels , kidney dysfunction , and subclinical hypothyroidism , but no autoantibodies associated with autoimmune connective tissue disorders were detected ( table 2a  b ) . \\n a ct scan showed a small to moderate amount of pleural effusion , a large amount of ascites , enlargement of both axillary lymph nodes , and multiple sclerotic bone lesions , but did not detect any tumors of the parenchymal organs or lymphadenopathy ( fig . \\n c ) . diagnostic aspiration indicated that the patient 's ascites ( table 3 ) was transudative , but not malignant . \\n a breast ultrasound scan detected a hypoechoic solid tumor ( size : ~1 cm ) containing internal echogenic spots with interruption of both the anterior and posterior borders of the mammary gland ( fig . \\n therefore , an ultrasoundguided needle biopsy was performed , leading to a histopathological diagnosis of hormone receptorpositive invasive ductal carcinoma without human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ( her2 ) protein overexpression ( fig . \\n although the diagnostic aspiration did not provide conclusive evidence of malignant effusion , after reflecting on the patient 's pathological characteristics , the physicians made a final diagnosis of stage iv / metastatic breast cancer with metastases involving the pleural cavity , peritoneal cavity , lymph nodes , and bone . \\n the patient began receiving tamoxifenbased hormonal therapy because chemotherapy was deemed inappropriate due to coexisting renal impairment . 1 month later , it became difficult for the patient to live at home because her massive ascites induced a bloating sensation accompanied by pain , shortness of breath , a diminished appetite , nausea , severe fatigue , and edema of the lower extremities . \\n therefore , she was admitted to our surgical ward in order to undergo peritoneal portcatheter placement to manage her refractory ascites . \\n laboratory findings.(a ) abnormal laboratory data obtained on admission and the changes in these parameters after chemotherapy treatment . \\n ( b ) a list of the autoantibodies associated with autoimmune connective tissue disorders that were tested for on admission bun : blood urea nitrogen , tsh : thyroidstimulating hormone , ft3 : free triiodothyronine , ft4 : free thyroxine , rnp : ribonucleoprotein , ssa : sjgren 's syndromerelated antigen a , anca : antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies , tpo : thyroid peroxidase . \\n [ correction added on 21 march 2016 after first online publication : the units in tables 2 and 3 were incorrect and have been updated in this version ] \\n ct scan obtained on admission . \\n bilateral axillary lymph node enlargement ( white arrows ) , ( b ) . a large amount of ascites , and ( c ) . a bone sclerotic lesion in the pubic symphysis ( white arrow ) . \\n the results indicated that the ascites was transudative , but not malignant [ correction added on 21 march 2016 after first online publication : the units in tables 2 and 3 were incorrect and have been updated in this version ] imaging studies of the right breast . \\n a breast ultrasound detected a hypoechoic solid tumor ( size : ~1 cm ) containing internal echogenic spots with interruption of both anterior and posterior border of the mammary gland ( white arrows ) . \\n histopathological examinations of the right breast an ultrasoundguided needle biopsy detected hormone receptorpositive invasive ductal carcinoma without human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ( her2 ) protein overexpression . \\n the surgeon who performed the physical examination on admission ( the lead author of this article ) noted that the patient had several characteristic physical findings : clubbing and hyperpigmentation of the fingers ( fig . \\n 4b ) ; and polyneuropathy , for example , numbness in both fingers , an inability to sense vibrations in both upper extremities , muscle weakness , and diminished deep tendon reflexes . \\n the detection of these characteristic physical findings triggered a fundamental review of the previous diagnosis , which required us to reexamine whether the patient 's breast cancer had played a causal role in the development of her pleural effusion , ascites , axillary lymphadenopathy , and sclerotic bone lesions . \\n when we considered all of the patient 's findings ( other than the breast cancer ) in a comprehensive manner , the differential diagnoses were divided into the following three categories : 1 hematological disorders , such as multiple myeloma , poems syndrome , monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance , waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia , cryoglobulinemia , and amyloidosis ; 2 immunemediated peripheral neuropathies , such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ; and 3 autoimmune connective tissue disorders , such as scleroderma . \\n however , autoimmune connective tissue disorders had already been ruled out , as mentioned above . on the other hand , the patient 's physical findings ; that is , the skin and neurological manifestations , represented valuable clues and led to an indepth examination for poems syndrome . skin changes ( a ) . \\n finger clubbing with hyperpigmentation ( b ) hyperpigmentation of the back with angiomas to examine whether the patient met the major criteria for poems syndrome ( table 1 ) , we performed an iliac crest bone marrow biopsy , a test for mprotein , and a nerve conduction velocity ( ncv ) test . \\n the bone marrow biopsy showed normal cellularity and did not detect any bone marrow plasma cell involvement , which excluded multiple myeloma . \\n 5 ) , and the ncv test demonstrated both demyelination and axonopathy in the right upper extremities ( table 4 ) , which were considered to be comorbidities of the patient 's peripheral polyneuropathy . \\n thereby , the diagnostic criteria for poems syndrome were fulfilled because one element of the other three major criteria ( sclerotic bone lesions ) and three of the minor criteria ( lymphadenopathy , extravascular volume overloading , and skin changes ) had already been met . \\n in addition , we obtained further strong evidence to support this diagnosis ; that is , a markedly raised vegf level ; the patient 's plasma and serum vegf levels were 555 pg / ml and 1530 pg / ml , respectively . \\n it has been reported that a plasma vegf level of 200 pg / ml exhibits 95% specificity and 68% sensitivity for diagnosing poems syndrome 3 . according to the japanese diagnostic criteria for poems syndrome issued by the japan intractable diseases information center \\n , a significantly elevated vegf level is defined as a serum level of > 1000 ng / ml 4 . \\n therefore , we were able to make a definitive diagnosis of poems syndrome in this rare case , which also involved synchronous breast cancer \\n a ncv study of the patient 's right side ncv , nerve conduction velocity . as a reference , \\n 22 this test detected mixed neuropathy in the median motor nerve and ulnar motor nerve ( a long latency , low amplitude , and low ncv ) , and axonal neuropathy in the right ulnar sensory nerve ( a low ncv ) . \\n the ncv of the median sensory nerve , tibial motor nerve , peroneal motor nerve , and sural sensory nerve were unmeasurable . immediately after the final diagnosis , \\n the patient began receiving chemotherapy based on a regimen for multiple myeloma ( 1.3 mg / m bortezomib , sc , on days 1 , 8 , 22 , and 29 of each cycle and 20 mg dexamethasone , po , on days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 22 , 23 , 29 , and 30 of each cycle ; each cycle lasted 6 weeks ) 5 as her condition was becoming increasingly lifethreatening . \\n after two courses of chemotherapy , the patient 's pleural effusion and ascites had almost disappeared , and her plasma and serum vegf levels fell significantly to 47 pg / ml and 266 pg / ml , respectively ; that is , below the diagnostic cutoff values of 200 pg / ml and 1000 pg / ml , respectively , indicating that these symptoms had been caused not by cancerous dissemination , but by poems syndrome . with the decreasing extravascular volume overload , her circulating plasma volume increased , leading to an improvement in her kidney function ( see table 2a ) , for example , her estimated glomerular filtration rate improved from 18 ml / min to 28 ml / min . \\n thus , the patient 's condition had improved markedly , and she was well enough to undergo a radical operation for breast cancer under general anesthesia . \\n a histopathological examination of the resected specimens detected a 10  5 mmsized invasive ductal carcinoma with no lymph node involvement ( 0/19 ) . when investigating the dissected axillary lymph nodes for poems syndrome , \\n none of the following histopathological features of castleman 's disease were detected : hyaline vascular , plasmacytic , or mixed lymph node features . \\n , adjuvant endocrine therapy ( 5 years ' tamoxifen treatment ) was considered sufficient . after receiving several more cycles of the same chemotherapy regimen , \\n the patient is scheduled to receive an autologous stem cell transplant in the near future , which is expected to result in a substantial improvement in her neuropathy 7 \\n 8 . \\n poems syndrome was first reported by crow in 1956 9 and was subsequently described by fukase in 1969 10 . \\n the acronym poems was coined by bardwick in 1980 11 and stands for the five main features of the disease ; that is , polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal gammopathy , and skin changes . \\n the syndrome was also referred to as crow  fukase syndrome by nakanishi in 1984 based on a japanese study of 102 cases 12 , and this name is more widely known in japan than poems syndrome . \\n although the pathophysiology of poems syndrome is poorly understood , the production of various inflammatory cytokines , such as interleukins ( il1 and il6 ) and vegf , by abnormal plasma cells is postulated to play a direct causal role in various symptoms of the condition 13 , 14 . in particular , \\n vegf levels exhibit the strongest correlations with disease activity in poems syndrome 3 , 15 . \\n plasma and serum vegf levels of 200 pg / ml and 1,000 pg / ml , respectively , are considered to be diagnostic cutoff values for poems syndrome . \\n elevated vegf levels are postulated to be involved in the pathogenesis of enhanced vascular permeability , increased endoneurial pressure , and the deposition of plasma cellderived material 14 , 16 , 17 , which eventually cause a variety of symptoms , including extravascular volume overloading ( edema , pleural effusion , and/or ascites ) , polyneuropathy ( demyelination ) , sclerotic bone lesions , and skin changes 18 , 19 . \\n however , the mixed results seen with antivegf therapy indicate that vegf might not be the driver of the clinical manifestations of poems syndrome 20 . \\n further studies of this issue are required . to the best of our knowledge ( based on a search of the pubmed database ) , this is the first case report about a case of poems syndrome with synchronous breast cancer . using \\n poems syndrome  and  synchronous cancer  as search keywords , we did not find any relevant articles ( accessed oct 19 , 2015 ) . at present \\n , there is no evidence that certain types of cancer are strongly associated with poems syndrome . \\n thus , it is likely that the current patient developed poems syndrome and breast cancer synchronously by chance . \\n the following three major factors might help to explain the diagnostic difficulties encountered in the present case . \\n first , poems syndrome is a rare disease ; its prevalence rate was reported to be 0.3 per 100,000 in japan 17 . however , there is another fact that some patients with poems syndrome are first diagnosed at autopsy or go undiagnosed unless properly autopsied because of diagnostic challenges specific to the syndrome 21 , which makes the actual prevalence rate unclear . \\n second , many of the signs and symptoms of poems syndrome mimic those of other disorders , leading to confusion and difficulties during the diagnostic process . \\n especially when being diagnosed with a certain type of cancer before the detection of preexisting poems syndrome , pleural effusion , ascites , lymphadenopathy , and bone lesions might be considered to be carcinomatous in origin . \\n the risk of such mistakes is probably higher in cases involving a metastasisprone cancer , for example , breast cancer . \\n third , clinicians have recently appeared to rely excessively on laboratory findings and/or imaging studies during the diagnostic process . \\n the present case should act as a warning against this unfavorable trend and could yield a bitter but helpful lesson that ,  the more complex a disease is , the more important a physical examination tends to be  .\",\n",

and polyneuropathy, for example, numbness in both fingers, an inability to sense vibrations in both upper extremities, muscle weakness, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. the detection of these characteristic physical findings triggered a fundamental review of the previous diagnosis, which required us to reexamine whether the patient\\'s breast cancer had played a causal role in the development of her pleural effusion, ascites, axillary lymphadenopathy, and sclerotic bone lesions. when we considered all of the patient\\'s findings ( other than the breast cancer ) in a comprehensive manner, the differential diagnoses were divided into the following three categories : 1 hematological disorders, such as multiple myeloma, poems syndrome, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, waldenstrom\\'s macroglobulinemia, cryoglobulinemia, and amyloidosis ; 2 immunemediated peripheral neuropathies, such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ; and 3 autoimmune connective tissue disorders, such as scleroderma. however, autoimmune connective tissue disorders had already been ruled out, as mentioned above. on the other hand, the patient\\'s physical findings ; that is, the skin and neurological manifestations, represented valuable clues and led to an indepth examination for poems syndrome. skin changes ( a ). finger clubbing with hyperpigmentation ( b ) hyperpigmentation of the back with angiomas to examine whether the patient met the major criteria for poems syndrome ( table 1 ), we performed an iliac crest bone marrow biopsy, a test for mprotein, and a nerve conduction velocity ( ncv ) test. the bone marrow biopsy showed normal cellularity and did not detect any bone marrow plasma cell involvement, which excluded multiple myeloma. 5 ), and the ncv test demonstrated both demyelination and axonopathy in the right upper extremities ( table 4 ), which were considered to be comorbidities of the patient\\'s peripheral polyneuropathy. thereby, the diagnostic criteria for poems syndrome were fulfilled because one element of the other three major criteria ( sclerotic bone lesions ) and three of the minor criteria ( lymphadenopathy, extravascular volume overloading, and skin changes ) had already been met. in addition, we obtained further strong evidence to support this diagnosis ; that is, a markedly raised vegf level ; the patient\\'s plasma and serum vegf levels were 555 pg / ml and 1530 pg / ml, respectively. it has been reported that a plasma vegf level of 200 pg / ml exhibits 95% specificity and 68% sensitivity for diagnosing poems syndrome 3. according to the japanese diagnostic criteria for poems syndrome issued by the japan intractable diseases information center, a significantly elevated vegf level is defined as a serum level of > 1000 ng / ml 4. therefore, we were able to make a definitive diagnosis of poems syndrome in this rare case, which also involved synchronous breast cancer a ncv study of the patient\\'s right side ncv, nerve conduction velocity. as a reference, 22 this test detected mixed neuropathy in the median motor nerve and ulnar motor nerve ( a long latency, low amplitude, and low ncv ), and axonal neuropathy in the right ulnar sensory nerve ( a low ncv ). the ncv of the median sensory nerve, tibial motor nerve, peroneal motor nerve, and sural sensory nerve were unmeasurable. immediately after the final diagnosis, the patient began receiving chemotherapy based on a regimen for multiple myeloma ( 1.3 mg / m bortezomib, sc, on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 of each cycle and 20 mg dexamethasone, po, on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 22, 23, 29, and 30 of each cycle ; each cycle lasted 6 weeks ) 5 as her condition was becoming increasingly lifethreatening. after two courses of chemotherapy, the patient\\'s pleural effusion and ascites had almost disappeared, and her plasma and serum vegf levels fell significantly to 47 pg / ml and 266 pg / ml, respectively ; that is, below the diagnostic cutoff values of 200 pg / ml and 1000 pg / ml, respectively, indicating that these symptoms had been caused not by cancerous dissemination, but by poems syndrome. with the decreasing extravascular volume overload, her circulating plasma volume increased, leading to an improvement in her kidney function ( see table 2a ), for example, her estimated glomerular filtration rate improved from 18 ml / min to 28 ml / min. thus, the patient\\'s condition had improved markedly, and she was well enough to undergo a radical operation for breast cancer under general anesthesia. a histopathological examination of the resected specimens detected a 10 5 mmsized invasive ductal carcinoma with no lymph node involvement ( 0/19 ). when investigating the dissected axillary lymph nodes for poems syndrome, none of the following histopathological features of castleman\\'s disease were detected : hyaline vascular, plasmacytic, or mixed lymph node features., adjuvant endocrine therapy ( 5 years\\'tamoxifen treatment ) was considered sufficient. after receiving several more cycles of the same chemotherapy regimen, the patient is scheduled to receive an autologous stem cell transplant in the near future, which is expected to result in a substantial improvement in her neuropathy 7 8. poems syndrome was first reported by crow in 1956 9 and was subsequently described by fukase in 1969 10. the acronym poems was coined by bardwick in 1980 11 and stands for the five main features of the disease ; that is, polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes. the syndrome was also referred to as crow fukase syndrome by nakanishi in 1984 based on a japanese study of 102 cases 12, and this name is more widely known in japan than poems syndrome. although the pathophysiology of poems syndrome is poorly understood, the production of various inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins ( il1 and il6 ) and vegf, by abnormal plasma cells is postulated to play a direct causal role in various symptoms of the condition 13, 14. in particular, vegf levels exhibit the strongest correlations with disease activity in poems syndrome 3, 15. plasma and serum vegf levels of 200 pg / ml and 1,000 pg / ml, respectively, are considered to be diagnostic cutoff values for poems syndrome. elevated vegf levels are postulated to be involved in the pathogenesis of enhanced vascular permeability, increased endoneurial pressure, and the deposition of plasma cellderived material 14, 16, 17, which eventually cause a variety of symptoms, including extravascular volume overloading ( edema, pleural effusion, and/or ascites ), polyneuropathy ( demyelination ), sclerotic bone lesions, and skin changes 18, 19. however, the mixed results seen with antivegf therapy indicate that vegf might not be the driver of the clinical manifestations of poems syndrome 20. further studies of this issue are required. to the best of our knowledge ( based on a search of the pubmed database ), this is the first case report about a case of poems syndrome with synchronous breast cancer. using poems syndrome and synchronous cancer as search keywords, we did not find any relevant articles ( accessed oct 19, 2015 ). at present, there is no evidence that certain types of cancer are strongly associated with poems syndrome. thus, it is likely that the current patient developed poems syndrome and breast cancer synchronously by chance. the following three major factors might help to explain the diagnostic difficulties encountered in the present case. first, poems syndrome is a rare disease ; its prevalence rate was reported to be 0.3 per 100,000 in japan 17. however, there is another fact that some patients with poems syndrome are first diagnosed at autopsy or go undiagnosed unless properly autopsied because of diagnostic challenges specific to the syndrome 21, which makes the actual prevalence rate unclear. second, many of the signs and symptoms of poems syndrome mimic those of other disorders, leading to confusion and difficulties during the diagnostic process. especially when being diagnosed with a certain type of cancer before the detection of preexisting poems syndrome, pleural effusion, ascites, lymphadenopathy, and bone lesions might be considered to be carcinomatous in origin. the risk of such mistakes is probably higher in cases involving a metastasisprone cancer, for example, breast cancer. third, clinicians have recently appeared to rely excessively on laboratory findings and/or imaging studies during the diagnostic process. the present case should act as a warning against this unfavorable trend and could yield a bitter but helpful lesson that, the more complex a disease is, the more important a physical examination tends to be. \"'},\n",

patient communication , as measured on two subscales from the established interpersonal processes of care questionnaire . \\n depressive symptoms were independently associated with poor reported explanations of condition and poor reported responsiveness to patient preferences , after adjustment for demographic factors , medical comorbidities and disease severity . in contrast , common medical comorbidities and objective measures of cardiac disease severity were not associated with reported doctor - patient communication . \\n these findings raise questions about whether self - reports of doctor - patient communication are in part a reflection of the psychological state of the patient . \\n patients with underlying mental disorders may be more likely to have unmet patient expectations,31 less likely to have their symptoms understood by their physicians,32 less involved in shared decision making33 and less satisfied with their care.34 to our knowledge , only one prior study has evaluated the influence of depressive symptom severity on patient reports of doctor - patient communication across different domains.24 this study , conducted in a cohort of adults with diabetes , found that depressive symptoms were associated with worse reports of doctor - patient communication on four out of seven subscales from the same interpersonal processes of care instrument . however , it was unclear how the association of depressive symptoms with poor reports of doctor - patient communication compared with medical comorbidities and objective measures of disease severity . \\n our study extends these important findings by reporting an association of depressive symptoms with reports of poor explanations of condition and responsiveness to patient preferences in a cohort of adults with chronic chd and by demonstrating that the association is not explained by medical comorbidities or worse cardiac function in depressed patients . \\n consistent with previous data , we found a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with chronic coronary disease.21,35,36 depression is a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes in this population . \\n patients with chd and concomitant depression are at increased risk for recurrence of cardiac events and for adverse cardiovascular outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery,21 independent of baseline cardiac disease severity.37 depression is associated with poor health - related quality of life in patients with chronic chd and more strongly predicts health status outcomes than objective measures of disease severity.25 our findings suggest that patients with depression are at increased risk for experiencing poor communication with their physicians . \\n poor experiences of doctor - patient communication  similar to poor perceived health status  may also lead to depressive symptoms . \\n the lack of association between medical comorbidities or disease severity and reports of poor communication implies that medical complexity may not compromise patients experiences of communication with their doctors to the same extent as depressive symptoms . \\n in addition to interventions focused on clinician communication skills , efforts to improve doctor - patient communication should include increased screening and treatment of patients with depressive symptoms . \\n referral to mental health services , when available , may assist primary care physicians in such evaluation and treatment . \\n physicians may also wish to explore different strategies for communicating information and sharing decisions with patients who are depressed . \\n poor experiences of communication in this population may signal a need for alternative communication models . \\n swenson hypothesized that differences in content , process or recall among patients with depression may result in poor communication.24 content refers to the challenge of dealing with multiple issues during a medical visit , which could lead to less time - sharing information . \\n our findings do not support the content explanation because communication was not associated with medical comorbidities or cardiac function . \\n the fact that sicker patients did not report worse communication suggests that visit content did not interfere with information exchange or shared decision making . \\n depressed patients may have difficulty discussing their health problems with physicians,22 have a more negative affect , be less well - liked by their doctors38 and/or make physicians feel more frustrated or less engaged,18 thereby placing a strain on interpersonal relationships , which may impede physician - patient communication . \\n visit recall means that depressed patients may have inaccurate or skewed recollections of what happened during a visit . \\n depressed patients may report poor communication in part because they view everything in a negative light . alternatively , difficulty with concentration , \\n a symptom of major depression,39 may impair patient recall of communication during the medical visit . while the process of communication may be objectively worse in patients with depressive symptoms , it is also possible that patients with depression perceive the same interactions differently . \\n depressive symptoms are associated with poor reports of doctor - patient communication , and the perceived quality of doctor - patient communication predicts patient satisfaction.40 thus , if patients with depressive symptoms report lower satisfaction with their physicians , is this because depressed patients perceive things differently or because their physicians are actually providing poorer quality care ? \\n the possibility that patients with depressive symptoms view clinical encounters through different lenses raises questions about the validity of patient self - report questionnaires used as measures of health - care quality . \\n first , we evaluated two aspects of doctor - patient communication , explanations of condition and responsiveness to patient preferences , using two subscales from the interpersonal processes of care instrument . \\n our study did not address other important components of doctor - patient communication including empathy , respectfulness , listening or empowerment.2,3,41 while explanations of condition and responsiveness to patient preferences are critical aspects of care , it is possible that the inclusion of additional measures of doctor - patient communication would have provided different results . \\n second , we studied patients with coronary heart disease , so our results may not generalize to patients with other illnesses . however , chd is a common chronic illness requiring frequent physician visits and associated with multiple medical comorbidities and high rates of depression . \\n third , it is possible that depression itself may have presented a barrier to participation in this study . \\n however , we found a high prevalence of depressive symptoms consistent with previous data.36 fourth , our participants spoke english , and the majority were male and white . although the interpersonal processes of care instrument was designed to compare doctor - patient communication across diverse racial / ethnic groups , our study sample did not allow us to make such comparisons . \\n fifth , we did not collect information about individual physicians . while previous work has demonstrated an association between physician characteristics and patient reports of doctor - patient communication,42 we were unable to evaluate physician predictors of communication or account for clustering at the physician level . \\n sixth , the interpersonal processes of care instrument is a patient self - report questionnaire ; we did not observe doctor - patient communication directly . \\n while patient perceptions of communication are important in and of themselves , direct observation might have allowed us to examine whether perceived differences in communication were more strongly associated with visit process or recall . \\n finally , this was a cross - sectional study ; thus , we were unable to evaluate causality . \\n in summary , patients with depressive symptoms are more likely to report poor doctor - patient communication than those without depressive symptoms . whether differences in perceived communication are due to differences in the communication process or to differences in recall among patients with depressive symptoms deserves further study . \\n patient reports are important in and of themselves and signal a need for increased awareness of the influence of depressive symptoms on experiences of doctor - patient communication . \\n however , further correlation with physician reports and/or direct observation may be necessary before such reports can be used as objective measures of health - care quality .',\n",

       "  'model_output': 'doctor - patient communication is considered an important marker of health - care quality,1 and the social - psychological aspects of the patient - physician interaction are increasingly recognized as complementary to the more technical aspects of medical care.2,3 high quality doctor - patient communication involves multiple domains, including ( 1 ) building an effective relationship, ( 2 ) gathering information, ( 3 ) understanding the patient s perspective, ( 4 ) giving information and ( 5 ) decision making.4,5 patients rate communication with their physicians as a valuable part of the medical encounter,6,7 and improved doctor - patient communication has been associated with higher patient satisfaction,6,8 self - management of chronic diseases,912 more appropriate prescribing of medications13 and improved health outcomes.1417 doctor - patient communication is particularly important in the management of chronic diseases, which may require frequent encounters with the medical system and complex treatment decisions. \\n patients with chronic disease often have multiple medical comorbidities and severe illness, presenting clinical challenges for physicians that may result in less attention to the social - psychological aspects of the patient - physician interaction.18,19 patients with chronic disease also suffer disproportionately from depression,20,21 which may complicate doctor - patient communication through the challenge of managing depression along with other medical conditions or because depressed patients experience or recall communication with their physicians differently.2224 however, little is known about the relative association of medical comorbidities, disease severity and depressive symptoms with doctor - patient communication. \\n we conducted this study to evaluate the association of medical comorbidities, disease severity and depressive symptoms with patient reports of doctor - patient communication in a cohort of adult patients with coronary heart disease ( chd ). \\n we chose to examine predictors of doctor - patient communication in this cohort because chd is a chronic illness associated with high rates of medical comorbidities and depression. \\n the heart and soul study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of adults with coronary heart disease ( chd ). \\n study recruitment procedures have been published previously.25 briefly, we used administrative databases to identify outpatients with documented chd at two veterans affairs medical centers in northern california ( san francisco and palo alto ), one university medical center ( university of california at san francisco ) and nine local community health clinics. \\n we defined documented chd as at least one of the following : a history of myocardial infarction, angiographic evidence of at least 50% stenosis in one or more coronary arteries, previous evidence of exercise - induced ischemia by treadmill or nuclear testing, a history of coronary artery revascularization or a diagnosis of chd by an internist or a cardiologist. \\n subjects were excluded if they had a history of myocardial infarction in the prior 6 months, could not walk one block or were planning to move from the local area within 3 years. \\n the majority of participants spoke english ; a small number of non - english - speaking patients participated through the assistance of an english - speaking family member. \\n after 315 participants had already been enrolled, additional funding enabled us to add instruments measuring doctor - patient communication as described below. \\n of the 709 remaining participants, 703 answered one or more questions about doctor - patient communication and were included in this cross - sectional study. \\n all subjects completed a day - long initial visit that involved an extensive structured questionnaire to measure demographic variables, medical comorbidities and psychosocial functioning, a resting echocardiogram and an exercise treadmill test with stress echocardiography. \\n the protocol was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards, and all participants provided written informed consent. \\n we assessed doctor - patient communication using the two - item explanations of condition subscale and the four - item responsiveness to patient preferences subscale from the interpersonal processes of care ( ipc ) instrument, an established self - report questionnaire designed to measure specific components of doctor - patient communication in diverse populations.2 details of the reliability and validity of the ipc instrument have been published previously.2 the questionnaire was self - administered with a research assistant available in the same room to help patients understand and interpret questions as necessary. \\n the explanations of condition subscale consisted of two questions :  how often did your doctor(s ) give you enough information about your health problems?  and  how often did your doctor(s ) make sure you understood your health problems? \\n the responsiveness to patient preferences subscale consisted of four questions :  how often did your doctor(s ) try to involve you or include you in decisions about your treatment? \\n how often did your doctor(s ) ask how you felt about different treatments?  how often did your doctor(s ) make decisions without taking your preferences or opinions into account?  and  how often did you feel pressured by your doctor(s ) to have a treatment you were nt sure you wanted?  for each question, patients were asked to report their experiences with their physician over the past 6  months on a five - point likert scale ranging from  never  to  always.  we generated a summary score for each subscale by adding up the total scores within the subscale and dividing by the number of questions. for participants who did not complete all questions in the subscale ( n  =  6 for explanations of condition and n  =  79 for responsiveness to patient preferences ), we divided by the number of answered questions. \\n higher scores indicate better experiences of doctor - patient communication ( the likert scale was reverse scored for negative characteristics ). \\n we evaluated the ipc subscales both as continuous variables and as dichotomous variables, with a score of < 4 on each subscale ( corresponding to never / rarely / sometimes for positive characteristics and always / often / sometimes for negative characteristics ) considered  poor  doctor - patient communication.26 we assessed depressive symptoms using the nine - item patient health questionnaire ( phq).27,28 we evaluated depressive symptoms both as a continuous variable ( range of scores 0 to 27 ) and as an ordinal variable, using previously established categories of none - minimal ( phq score of 03 ), mild ( phq score of 49 ) or moderate - severe ( phq score 10 ) depressive symptoms.28 medical comorbidities ( history of hypertension, diabetes and myocardial infarction ) were assessed by patient questionnaire. \\n we assessed disease severity using three objective measures of cardiac function : a resting two - dimensional echocardiogram for measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ), an exercise treadmill test for measurement of exercise capacity and a stress echocardiogram for assessment of inducible ischemia. \\n we performed a symptom - limited, graded exercise treadmill test according to a standard bruce protocol, a widely adopted and validated measure of exercise capacity and ischemic heart disease.29 peak exercise capacity was defined as the total number of metabolic equivalent tasks ( mets ) achieved. \\n poor exercise capacity was defined a priori as < 5 mets.30 inducible ischemia was defined as the presence of exercise - induced electrocardiographic changes or new echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities at peak exercise. \\n education was measured by asking participants  what is the highest level of education that you have completed?

       "  'input': 'the majority of epidemiological studies have based their prevalence estimates on symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation , the cardinal symptoms of gerd , which have been reported to occur on a daily basis by 10% of the adult population in the united states1 and 7.3% in brazil.2 many aspects of the physiopathology , diagnosis and treatment of gerd have been reviewed in detail35 and are relatively well known . despite the advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of this disease , however , some important areas still remain incompletely understood , such as the prevalence and nature of comorbid disorders . \\n the objective of this study was to investigate the point prevalence of comorbid disorders in gerd and to assess their connection with age , gender , smoking habits and the clinical presentation of the disease ( i.e. , non - erosive reflux disease ( nerd ) vs. erosive gerd ) in so paulo , brazil . \\n a total of 670 prospective , consecutive adult patients with gerd who had been referred to the outpatient clinic of the esophageal diseases sector of the hospital das clnicas of the university of so paulo , a tertiary medical referral center , between september 2006 and december 2007 were enrolled . \\n the diagnosis of gerd was established on the basis of the cardinal symptoms , namely heartburn and acid regurgitation , occurring two or more times a week , with or without other symptoms , for at least 8 weeks.6,9 the los angeles endoscopic grading system for esophagitis severity8 was used for the endoscopic diagnosis of erosive esophagitis . \\n nerd was diagnosed by the presence of troublesome reflux - associated symptoms and the absence of mucosal breaks at endoscopy7 , in addition to 24-hour ambulatory ph - metry in the context of acid reflux.10 during the medical consultation , an extensive review of the patient s medical file was carried out , including documentation of all previous medical consultations involving different hospital services . during this review , \\n all established diagnoses and prescribed treatments , as well as the results of any related investigations were recorded . \\n all comorbidities ( cms ) were diagnosed according to established criteria.11,12 all data were recorded in the patient s report forms , which also included detailed information regarding the diagnosis and treatment of gerd . \\n patients were excluded if they had previously undergone gastrointestinal surgery , or if they suffered from barrett s esophagus or other complications as evidenced during upper endoscopy . \\n women were required to be non - pregnant , non - lactating and on a medically acceptable form of birth control . \\n the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the hospital das clinicas of the university of so paulo school of medicine ( cappesq ) . \\n a descriptive analysis was used to document the demographic and clinical data related to the patient cohort . to test for age - related statistical differences between the genders , \\n comparisons of the proportions among groups with regard to gender were evaluated using a binomial test , with a null hypothesis of 50% for each sex . a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant . \\n statistical software r version 2.6.2 for windows ( r foundation for statistical computing , usa ) was used for data processing and analyses . \\n the duration of gerd history among the 670 patients ranged from 8 weeks to 20 years ( mean : 9.2 years ) . in total \\n , we studied 211 ( 31.4% ) males and 459 ( 68.6% ) females ; of these , 586 ( 87.5% ) had documented comorbidities , and 84 ( 12.5% ) did not . \\n of the patients with cms , 423 ( 72.1% ) were female and 163 ( 27.9% ) were male ( p<0.0001 ) . \\n of those without cms , 48 ( 57.2% ) were male and 36 ( 42.8% ) were female ( p=0.2301 ) ( table 1 ) . at endoscopy , \\n 316 patients presented erosive esophagitis ( 47.1% ) and 354 ( 52.9% ) did not . \\n of the 316 patients with erosive esophagitis , 202 ( 63.9% ) were female and 114 ( 36.1% ) were male ( p<0.0001 ) . \\n of the 354 patients with non - erosive reflux disease , 257 ( 72.6% ) were female and 97 ( 27.4% ) were male ( p<0.0001 ) ( table 2 ) . \\n ages in the studied population ranged from 18 to 80 years , with a mean of 55.94 years ( ci 95% : 54.93 ; 56.96 ) . \\n the mean ages for males and females were 55.81 ( ci 95%:53.75 ; 57.87 ) and 56.0 ( ci 95%:54.87 ; 57.12 ) years , respectively . \\n a total of 1,664 instances of comorbidities among 586 patients ( 87.5% ) were identified . \\n the ten most common comorbidities , which accounted for 1,099 occurrences ( 66.0% of the total ) , corresponding to 509 patients ( 75.9% of the total ) , are shown in table 3 \\n . a higher frequency of comorbidities occurred in the age range of 61 to 70 years , with 354 instances ( 21.2% of the total occurrences ) , and in the age range of 51 to 60 years , with 336 instances ( 20.1% of the total occurrences ) . \\n the occurrence rate of the ten most prevalent cms according to age range is shown in table 4 . \\n the numbers of patients by age range were : 1820 years , 1 ; 2130 years , 22(3% ) ; 3140 years , 59 ( 9% ) ; 4150 years , 141 ( 21% ) ; 5160 years , 189 ( 28% ) ; 6170 years , 163 ( 24% ) ; and 7180 years , 93 ( 14% ) . \\n as seen from table 5 , the occurrence of cms was significantly higher in patients with nerd ( p=0.0014 ) . \\n furthermore , in patients with erosive disease most comorbidities were associated with patients suffering from milder grades of esophagitis ( i.e. , los angeles grades a and b ) ( p<0.0001 ) . \\n comorbidities among patients with the aforementioned grades accounted for 92.14% ( ci95% : 89.32% ; 94.28% ) of the total number of comorbidities associated with erosive gerd . \\n to our knowledge , very few original papers have analyzed the prevalence of cms in gerd , an acid - related disorder that develops when the reflux of gastric contents induces troublesome symptoms , with or without esophageal mucosal damage and/or complications7 . \\n gerd may present with a broad spectrum of symptoms , but the cardinal manifestations are heartburn and acid regurgitation . in our study , we considered these adequate for the preliminary diagnosis of gerd . \\n complications of the disease , including barrett s esoophagus , stenosis and ulcers , are often associated with other clinical manifestations and , as such , were excluded from the present study . as expected , a majority of the patients ( 53% ) presented with the non -

erosive reflux disease ( nerd ) vs. erosive gerd ) in so paulo, brazil. \\n a total of 670 prospective, consecutive adult patients with gerd who had been referred to the outpatient clinic of the esophageal diseases sector of the hospital das clnicas of the university of so paulo, a tertiary medical referral center, between september 2006 and december 2007 were enrolled. \\n the diagnosis of gerd was established on the basis of the cardinal symptoms, namely heartburn and acid regurgitation, occurring two or more times a week, with or without other symptoms, for at least 8 weeks.6,9 the los angeles endoscopic grading system for esophagitis severity8 was used for the endoscopic diagnosis of erosive esophagitis. \\n nerd was diagnosed by the presence of troublesome reflux - associated symptoms and the absence of mucosal breaks at endoscopy7, in addition to 24-hour ambulatory ph - metry in the context of acid reflux.10 during the medical consultation, an extensive review of the patient s medical file was carried out, including documentation of all previous medical consultations involving different hospital services. during this review, \\n all established diagnoses and prescribed treatments, as well as the results of any related investigations were recorded. \\n all comorbidities ( cms ) were diagnosed according to established criteria.11,12 all data were recorded in the patient s report forms, which also included detailed information regarding the diagnosis and treatment of gerd. \\n patients were excluded if they had previously undergone gastrointestinal surgery, or if they suffered from barrett s esophagus or other complications as evidenced during upper endoscopy. \\n women were required to be non - pregnant, non - lactating and on a medically acceptable form of birth control. \\n the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the hospital das clinicas of the university of so paulo school of medicine ( cappesq ). \\n a descriptive analysis was used to document the demographic and clinical data related to the patient cohort. to test for age - related statistical differences between the genders, \\n comparisons of the proportions among groups with regard to gender were evaluated using a binomial test, with a null hypothesis of 50% for each sex. a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. \\n statistical software r version 2.6.2 for windows ( r foundation for statistical computing, usa ) was used for data processing and analyses. \\n the duration of gerd history among the 670 patients ranged from 8 weeks to 20 years ( mean : 9.2 years ). in total \\n, we studied 211 ( 31.4% ) males and 459 ( 68.6% ) females ; of these, 586 ( 87.5% ) had documented comorbidities, and 84 ( 12.5% ) did not. \\n of the patients with cms, 423 ( 72.1% ) were female and 163 ( 27.9% ) were male ( p<0.0001 ). \\n of those without cms, 48 ( 57.2% ) were male and 36 ( 42.8% ) were female ( p=0.2301 ) ( table 1 ). at endoscopy, \\n 316 patients presented erosive esophagitis ( 47.1% ) and 354 ( 52.9% ) did not. \\n of the 316 patients with erosive esophagitis, 202 ( 63.9% ) were female and 114 ( 36.1% ) were male ( p<0.0001 ). \\n of the 354 patients with non - erosive reflux disease, 257 ( 72.6% ) were female and 97 ( 27.4% ) were male ( p<0.0001 ) ( table 2 ). \\n ages in the studied population ranged from 18 to 80 years, with a mean of 55.94 years ( ci 95% : 54.93 ; 56.96 ). \\n the mean ages for males and females were 55.81 ( ci 95%:53.75 ; 57.87 ) and 56.0 ( ci 95%:54.87 ; 57.12 ) years, respectively. \\n a total of 1,664 instances of comorbidities among 586 patients ( 87.5% ) were identified. \\n the ten most common comorbidities, which accounted for 1,099 occurrences ( 66.0% of the total ), corresponding to 509 patients ( 75.9% of the total ), are shown in table 3 \\n. a higher frequency of comorbidities occurred in the age range of 61 to 70 years, with 354 instances ( 21.2% of the total occurrences ), and in the age range of 51 to 60 years, with 336 instances ( 20.1% of the total occurrences ). \\n the occurrence rate of the ten most prevalent cms according to age range is shown in table 4. \\n the numbers of patients by age range were : 1820 years, 1 ; 2130 years, 22(3% ) ; 3140 years, 59 ( 9% ) ; 4150 years, 141 ( 21% ) ; 5160 years, 189 ( 28% ) ; 6170 years, 163 ( 24% ) ; and 7180 years, 93 ( 14% ). \\n as seen from table 5, the occurrence of cms was significantly higher in patients with nerd ( p=0.0014 ). \\n furthermore, in patients with erosive disease most comorbidities were associated with patients suffering from milder grades of esophagitis ( i.e., los angeles grades a and b ) ( p<0.0001 ). \\n comorbidities among patients with the aforementioned grades accounted for 92.14% ( ci95% : 89.32% ; 94.28% ) of the total number of comorbidities associated with erosive gerd. \\n to our knowledge, very few original papers have analyzed the prevalence of cms in gerd, an acid - related disorder that develops when the reflux of gastric contents induces troublesome symptoms, with or without esophageal mucosal damage and/or complications7. \\n gerd may present with a broad spectrum of symptoms, but the cardinal manifestations are heartburn and acid regurgitation. in our study, we considered these adequate for the preliminary diagnosis of gerd. \\n complications of the disease, including barrett s esoophagus, stenosis and ulcers, are often associated with other clinical manifestations and, as such, were excluded from the present study. as expected, a majority of the patients ( 53% ) presented with the non -

       "  'input': \"type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) is characterized by immune - mediated destruction of the insulin - secreting  cells in the pancreatic islets as a result of an unknown trigger mechanism . \\n it is , however , well known that development of clinical disease is preceded by an asymptomatic latent period during which immune reactions against the insulin - secreting cell autoantigens can be demonstrated [ 13 ] . in this context , biochemically detectable autoantibodies against insulin ( iaa ) , glutamic acid decarboxylase ( gada ) , insulinoma - associated antigen 2 ( ia-2a ) , and zn - transporter 8 ( znt8a ) as well as their counterpart immunofluorescent anti - islet antibodies ( ica ) serve as reliable biomarkers for t1d development . \\n specifically , knip et al .   demonstrated that all children initially testing positive for both gada and ia-2a progressed to clinical t1d over a 26-year followup . over the last few decades the incidence of t1d has dramatically increased in many countries particularly in early childhood , suggesting that an event associated with progression towards t1d disease was occurring early in life . \\n an increasing number of studies have suggested that the composition of the intestinal microbiota might contribute significantly to the development of disorders such as t1d since changes to the microflora mirror changes in general life styles and the social system [ 46 ] . \\n it is believed that intestinal colonization with certain bacteria strongly influences systemic immune responses early in life and may play a significant role in modulating the development of various chronic diseases . \\n some of the most common constituents of the gastrointestinal tract microbiota include bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species that have been shown to play a significant role in the development of immune - mediated disorders in humans [ 811 ] . \\n that is , predominant colonization with b. adolescentis has been reported in patients with allergic disorders compared to colonization patterns observed in individuals with nonallergic disorders [ 1214 ] . \\n other bifidobacterium species have been shown to have diverse effects , including variable associations of b. longum with immune - mediated and inflammatory diseases . \\n studies of rodent disease models [ 15 , 16 ] have also identified differences in the ability of different bifidobacterium species in modulating immune reactivity and inflammation . \\n most well known are the effects of the probiotic strain l. rhamnosus gg in preventing atopic eczema among infants , possibly by modulating the immune response to allergens . \\n the recent identification of the l. rhamnosus gg p40 molecule as an immunomodulator   represents a significant step forward towards resolving problems related to the effects of probiotics in vivo . \\n previously we demonstrated that the elicitation of antibodies against l. acidophilus antigenic components differed between children with various chronic diseases . \\n the current study describes experiments designed to extend these observations by investigating the prevalence of serum antibodies against b. adolescentis , b. longum , and l. rhamnosus gg in young children that developed or did not develop t1d . \\n plasma samples ( n = 107 ) from 38 children participating in the finnish type 1 diabetes prediction and prevention ( dipp ) study and born between 1995 and 2003 were included in this study . \\n children were separated into 2 groups of 19 children ( 11 females ) each matched for age and sex . \\n one group was comprised of children who later developed at least 2 t1d - related autoantibodies and subsequently clinical t1d ( islet autoimmunity [ ia ] , i.e. , the ia - positive group ) and the other group was comprised of children that did not develop or present with signs of islet autoimmunity ( ia - negative group ) and without t1d during followup . \\n islet autoimmunity was defined in this context as detection of at least 2 antibodies out of gada ( assay sensitivity 82% , specificity 96% ) , ia-2a ( assay sensitivity 72% , specificity 100% ) , and/or ica . \\n levels of ica were measured by an indirect immunofluorescence assay with a detection limit of 2.5 juvenile diabetes foundation units . \\n all children in the ia - positive group later developed t1d ( age at onset ranged between 2.4 and 10.3 years ) . \\n both groups were similar in their documented use of antibiotics ( during the first 2 years of life 13/18 ia - positive children and 17/18 ia - negative children were treated with antibiotics ; \\n p = 0.177 ; the data pertaining to one child from each group was not available ) . \\n no differences in the use of probiotics between groups were observed ( 2 children from the ia - positive group ; p = 0.487 ) . \\n wilkins - chalgren agar ( oxoid , uk ) was used to culture b. adolescentis dsm 20083 ( atcc 15703 ) and dsm 20086 ( atcc 15705 ) and b. longum dsm 20088 ( atcc 15697 ) . \\n man - rogosa - sharpe agar ( oxoid , uk ) was used to culture l. rhamnosus gg . \\n wilkins - chalgren agar plates were incubated in an anaerobic cabinet ( concept , uk ; with gas mixture of 5% co2 , 5% h2 , and 90% n2 ) and man - rogosa - sharpe agar in a microaerobic environment ( joan , france ) with a gas mixture of 10% co2 for 48  h. bacterial cells were collected , suspended in phosphate - buffered saline solution ( pbs , ph = 7.4 ) , and washed 3 times with the same buffer . \\n subsequently , cells were disrupted with 0.1  mm glass beads ( biospec products , usa ) in pbs in the presence of complete protease inhibitors ( boehringen mannheim - roche , switzerland ) on ice . \\n the total protein concentration in lysates was determined using the protein assay solution ( bio - rad , usa ) using bovine serum albumin as a standard and kept in aliquots at 20c until used . \\n preparations were mixed with 300  l sds - page sample buffer and heated for 15  min at 95c . \\n the proteins in the bacterial cell lysate were loaded on a 520% gradient gel with a 5% concentrating gel with all blue 10250  kda molecular weight ( mw ) markers ( bio - rad , usa ) as standards and separated by electrophoresis using a current of 40  ma and a voltage of 200 v for 6  h using a vertical electrophoresis system se-600 ( hoefer , usa ) connected to a thermostatic circulator . \\n separated proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) membrane ( 0.45  m pore size ) using a semidry electroblotter ( hoefer , usa ) at a current density of 1  ma / cm for 1.5  h and membranes blocked as described by nilsson et al . . \\n five mm wide strips were cut from the membrane and incubated with plasma samples diluted to 1  :  50 for iga and igm and 1  :  100 for igg in the incubating buffer   overnight at 4c . \\n strips were then incubated with either secondary anti - human iga , anti - human igm , or anti - human igg antibodies labelled with horse - radish peroxidase ( hrp ) ( diluted 1  :  500 ; dako , denmark ) for 1  h and subsequently developed in substrate solution comprised of 0.04% carbazole in 50  mm sodium acetate buffer ( ph = 5.0 ) and hydrogen peroxide ( 0.015% ) for 30  min at room temperature . \\n the strips were scanned using a bio - rad gs-710 imaging densitometer ( bio - rad , usa ) . \\n the relative mw of the bands was estimated with the bio - rad quantity one image analysis software ( bio - rad , usa ) according to the all blue molecular weight markers . \\n the f - test was used to compare the frequency of antibodies in the two groups . \\n we first analyzed the dynamics of igg antibodies that developed against l. rhamnosus gg target antigens in children between 3 and 24 months of age . \\n this approach was chosen due to the frequent consumption of the probiotic l. rhamnosus gg - containing dairy products by children and adults in finland . \\n we discovered 25 clearly distinguishable l. rhamnosus gg antigenic proteins ranging between 11 and 86  kda ( table 1 ) . \\n the number of l. rhamnosus gg proteins recognized by igg increased steadily with age . \\n children between the ages of 12 and 24 months presented with significantly more antibodies against 5/9 ( 31 , 42 , 45 , 47 , and 49  kda proteins ) selected highly reactive proteins compared to reactivity observed in 3-month - old infants . however , no significant differences in igg reactivity were observed in response to l. rhamnosus gg antigens between ia - positive and ia - negative children . \\n the average number of igg - reactive l. rhamnosus gg protein bands was 10.5  6.6 in ia - positive infants ( between 5 and 17 bands ) and 11.5  7.2 in ia - negative children ( between 5 and 20 bands ) at 12 months of age . based on these results \\n the 12-month - old group was chosen for further analysis of immune reactivity against bifidobacterium spp \\n igg bound to bifidobacterium antigens in the molecular weight ranging from 7  kda to 131  kda . \\n the number of proteins recognized varied between strains with the greatest number of reactive antigens observed for b. longum dsm 20088 ( n = 57 ; table 1 ) . the average number of igg - reactive proteins in assays with b. adolescentis dsm 20083 , b. adolescentis dsm 20086 , and b. longum dsm 20088 strains was not significantly different between ia - positive children and ia - negative subjects ( figures 13 ) . \\n iga bound to protein antigens in the molecular weight ranging from 7  kda to 104  kda ( table 1 ) . similar to the igg antibody results , more b. longum dsm 20088 proteins were recognized by iga than any other tested bacteria . \\n the average number of b. adolescentis dsm 20083 proteins bound by iga was lower than the number of proteins bound from other strains . \\n there was a significant difference in the number of proteins reactive to antibodies between the 2 groups of children : 1.9  2.6 reactive protein bands in ia - positive infants and 1.2  1.2 reactive protein bands in ia - negative children ( p < 0.003 ; figure 1 ) . \\n also in tests with bifidobacterium strains the average number of reacting antigenic proteins tended to be at a higher frequency in the ia - positive group compared to the ia - negative group ( figures 2 and 3 ) . \\n igm bound to bacterial proteins in the molecular weight ranging from 13  kda to 84  kda . \\n the average number of igm reacting protein bands in both assays either with b. adolescentis dsm 20083 or with b. adolescentis dsm 20086 was higher in ia - positive than in ia - negative infants , but this difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.235 and p = 0.285 , resp . ; \\n this study investigated the reactivity of serum antibodies against the probiotic strain l. rhamnosus gg and selected natural bifidobacterium spp . \\n proteins in children 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24 months of age using an immunoblot assay developed previously by our group . \\n l. rhamnosus gg is included into the most commonly used dairy products in finland , whereas all chosen bifidobacterium strains , b. adolescentis dsm 20083 , b. adolescentis dsm 20086 , and b. longum dsm 20088 , are usual inhabitants of the intestinal microbiota . \\n the colonization of newborns with microbes begins during delivery and by 2 months of age 91% of infants are colonized with b. longum , 75% with b. adolescentis , and 57% with lactobacilli group \\n i ( l. rhamnosus , l. casei , and l. paracasei ) . a shift in colonization with b. adolescentis strains towards earlier \\n life has been demonstrated recently   and this has also been observed at the age of 5 years . \\n the population studied here was obtained from the finnish dipp study and divided into 2 groups based on the development of diabetes - associated autoantibodies and t1d over a 10-year followup . \\n immunoblot analyses of bacterial lysates demonstrated a substantial increase in the frequency of igg antibody reactivity to l. rhamnosus gg proteins between 6 and 12 months of age , showing that the most conspicuous increase in antibody production occurred before the age of 12 months . in spite of these age - dependent changes , reactions against l. rhamnosus gg proteins \\n were seen in ia - positive and ia - negative subjects at a similar frequency . \\n this result indicated that igg antibodies reactive to probiotic strain l. rhamnosus gg proteins were not suggestive of progression toward -cell autoimmunity or development of t1d in children . \\n the most important observation made from immunoblot assays testing antibody reactivity to l. rhamnosus gg proteins was the age - related dynamics associated with the development of circulating antibodies to microbial proteins . \\n proteins since these organisms are known to colonize the infant 's gut early in life . \\n we assessed binding to different antigenic proteins from b. adolescentis dsm 20083 , b. adolescentis dsm 20086 , and b. longum dsm 20088 by igg , iga , and igm class antibodies and observed that iga bound significantly more b. adolescentis dsm 20083 strain antigens in children who developed islet autoimmunity and t1d later in life . at the same time we could not find any significant differences between the two groups of children in the frequencies of igg or iga antibodies against other bifidobacteria strains \\n it is noteworthy that we found that b. longum proteins were recognized by igg and iga antibodies to a substantially higher extent compared to other bacteria studied . \\n this phenomenon may indicate a stronger stimulation of the infant 's immune system by b. longum protein antigens \\n . some of the immunoreactive bands detected may be due to cross -

related dynamics associated with the development of circulating antibodies to microbial proteins. \\nproteins since these organisms are known to colonize the infant's gut early in life. \\nwe assessed binding to different antigenic proteins from b. adolescentis dsm 20083, b. adolescentis dsm 20086, and b. longum dsm 20088 by igg, iga, and igm class antibodies and observed that iga bound significantly more b. adolescentis dsm 20083 strain antigens in children who developed islet autoimmunity and t1d later in life. at the same time we could not find any significant differences between the two groups of children in the frequencies of igg or iga antibodies against other bifidobacteria strains \\nit is noteworthy that we found that b. longum proteins were recognized by igg and iga antibodies to a substantially higher extent compared to other bacteria studied. \\nthis phenomenon may indicate a stronger stimulation of the infant's immune system by b. longum protein antigens \\n. some of the immunoreactive bands detected may be due to cross - reactive antibodies that developed in response to bacterial antigens from species not used in this study. \\nit is however very difficult to make this distinction since we presently have no tools ( monoclonal antibodies ) to discriminate between strain - specific reactivity and cross - reactivity. \\nregardless, it was clear that differences in the development of iga antibodies with reactivity against b. adolescentis dsm 20083 ( atcc 15703 ) antigens were present independent of the mechanism involved. \\nit is of particular importance to note that differences between the 2 groups were associated with reactivity by iga but not igg or igm class antibodies. \\niga with reactivity against commensal intestinal microbes can develop as a consequence of colonization with high numbers of organisms at the mucosal surface. \\nit has been shown that oral administration of the probiotic mixture vsl#3 that includes 8 different probiotic strains ( including 3 bifidobacteria strains ) prevented the development of autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice. \\ndifferent bifidobacteria strains have clearly been shown to have variable influences on immune responses [ 23, 24 ]. \\nthe species of b. adolescentis most commonly isolated from allergic children has been shown to more effectively trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines compared to other strains of bifidobacteria [ 25, 26 ] supporting our results that demonstrated differences between children with and without signs of -cell autoimmunity with regard to reactivity to b. adolescentis strain 20083 antigens which might impact t1d development. \\nwhether these differences are in some way linked to differences in the microbiome needs further studies [ 27, 28 ]. in conclusion, during the first year of life the immune system starts to produce antibodies which recognize antigens produced by organisms comprising the normal microbiota. \\nalthough some of these proteins may contain common antigenic epitopes present on proteins produced by various bacteria, our current study showed that differences in antibody reactivities could be found even between the same species of b. adolescentis. \\nthese differences might reflect a propensity for developing t1d confirming recent findings regarding differences in the gut microbiome between children affected and unaffected by t1d. \\nfurther studies will be needed to verify how the presence of this particular b. adolescentis dsm 20083 strain in the intestine of children is involved in predisposing individuals to developing -cell autoimmunity and t1d.\"},\n",

loss performed in a short time the victims \\n having undergone dehydration of up to 15%1 . following these deaths in 1997 , the national collegiate athletic \\n association ( ncaa ) initiated and developed new safety precautions in order to prevent unsafe \\n weight practices2 . \\n after studies of this \\n subject , ncaa decided that competition -

loss should not exceed 1.5% of body weight as a part of the wrestling \\n weight certification ( wwc ) program4 . \\n however , the most important reason why athletes lose weight is that they want to compete in \\n the lowest weight - class possible , and they think that the time between weighing and \\n competition ( ~16 hours ) is sufficient for rehydration after dehydration5 . \\n nevertheless , studies report that this time period of ~16 \\n hours is not enough to regain the body - weight lost6 and dehydration decreases athletes performances , too7 . \\n it was reported that when athletes of \\n particularly combat sports such as judo , karate , boxing and wrestling perform excessively \\n severe dehydration in a short time ( 17 days ) , they undergo some hematologic changes8 , 9 \\n . \\n there would be changes not only in posm levels , but also in na , bun \\n and glucose levels due to posm10 , 11 . \\n it was reported that athletes who perform \\n weight -

loss just before the \\n competition ( 17 days ) ( table 1 ) . \\n the level of \\n posm of the wrestlers who underwent fast weight - loss was above the reference \\n range ( upper limit : 290 ) ( 296.053.14 ) and they suffered dehydration of 4.55% . \\n these results \\n of posm level of the wrestlers were similar to the results of usg29 , 30 . \\n serum na and bun levels were higher among the dehydrated wrestlers due to the \\n increase in posm , but no differences were seen in their glucose values ( table 1 ) . in the literature \\n mmol / l . when the na \\n concentration in a blood sample is 135 \\n mmol / l it is defined as hyponatremia , and when it is \\n 145 , it is defined as hypernatremia31 . \\n it has been reported that the na+ concentration generally remains high due to long - term \\n physical activities and excessive sweating and deficiency in all body fluids , and that \\n na gradually increases with time32 , \\n 33 . \\n it has been recommended that during \\n exercises , athletes should keep serum na concentration within the reference \\n range through a controlled diet34 , \\n otherwise nervousness , over - reaction , lethargy , muscle contraction , spasticity , convulsions , \\n coma and even mortality may occur . \\n it is our opinion that the differences in bun values resulted from the fact that wrestlers \\n did long - term exhausting exercises and/or adhered to food and fluid restriction programs for \\n dehydration . since bun is closely associated with the metabolic functions of the liver , and \\n the filtrating and excreting functions of the kidneys , dehydration may increase35 . indeed , \\n the study of mashiko et al . \\n reported that according to measurements before and after a 20 day camp , rugby players lost \\n weight and as a result their bun levels decreased owing to weight loss36 . \\n the fact that there were no differences in the glucose values of the dehydrated wrestlers \\n made us think that adrenaline increased by exercises converts glycogens stored in liver into \\n glucose and glucose flows into blood with the help of glucagons and , as a result , regulates \\n blood glucose levels . \\n differences in na and bun values affect posm \\n values of the athletes and change their hydration status . \\n it is stated that dehydration of \\n 23% causes cognitive disorders , irregular body temperature , cardiovascular dysfunctions as \\n well as reduced endurance and weakens muscle strength37,38,39 . \\n there were significant differences in terms of the damage to skeletal muscles between the \\n dehydrated wrestlers and not dehydrated wrestlers . \\n the \\n differences between the hydration levels and the skeletal muscle damage was determined \\n according to the classification of casa et al . , and in our study it was noted that there \\n were significant differences in ast , ldh and ck , but no differences were found in alt values \\n ( tables 2 and 3 ) between the two groups . in the \\n study of nathwaniet \\n et al . , it was reported that serum levels of ck , ldh , ast , alt increased \\n following muscle damage13 . under normal \\n conditions , \\n these elevated levels may be tolerated by the athletes with nutritional and \\n relaxation programs , but among the dehydrated athletes , metabolism consumes low levels of \\n carbohydrate due to food and fluid restrictions and uses an energy combination of fat and \\n proteins ; thus , glucose inhibition occurring with high plasma and free fat acids suggest \\n that the damage to the muscles of the wrestlers would continue40 , 41 . in clinical practice , \\n ck , ldh , ast , alt were commonly used for the diagnosis of skeletal \\n muscle diseases and skeletal muscle tissue damage42 . \\n the ldh level is accepted to \\n be a specific indicator of fatigue44 , 45 . \\n ast , being a cytoplasmic and \\n mitochondrial enzyme , may increase in many clinical disorders , but alt has been reported to \\n be a specific indicator of liver damage13 . in our study , serum ck and ldh levels , important damage indicators , \\n were higher in the dehydrated group than in the not dehydrated group . among the dehydrated \\n wrestlers , the high level of serum ck would have affected their performance negatively as \\n well as restricted their movements because of muscle pains . \\n it is also possible that the \\n high level of serum ldh may cause wrestlers to be reluctant and/or unwilling for the next \\n exercise . \\n when aminotransferases were investigated , levels of ast and alt were increased . \\n however , while there was a significant difference in ast levels , no significant difference \\n was seen in alt level , which demonstrates that ast exists in higher amounts in skeletal \\n muscles than alt . \\n serum levels of all these damage indicators reduced after exercises and \\n correlated with relaxation and feeding after exercises46 . \\n all of the participant wrestlers reported that they did daily \\n exercises and training . therefore ; it is our opinion that the high level of skeletal muscle \\n damage among the dehydrated wrestlers was caused by food and fluid restriction following \\n exercises . \\n c - rp is a major acute phase reactant that increases acutely and quickly in response to \\n tissue damage and infection47 . in a \\n systematic study of c - rp , it was found that as an acute phase response , c - rp temporally \\n increased after a single exercise protocol among trained athletes . however , in prospective \\n studies , it was demonstrated that c - rp ( pretest - posttest ) levels of the exercise groups \\n reduced . \\n in other words : although physical activity increased c - rp levels , chronic physical \\n exercises reduced c - rp levels48 . \\n c - rp levels of the participant athletes of both groups were low and no difference existed \\n between the groups . \\n considering the fact that these athletes had a sportive experience of at \\n least five years , it was expected that they would have increased tissue oxygenation because \\n of having regularly exercised for years . \\n uww ( united world wrestling ) shortened the resting - time in competitions of the wrestling \\n championships , aiming at muscle endurance among the wrestlers . in a wrestling tournament , \\n the qualifications , \\n semi - finals and even finals , time between bouts will be short , and resting - time not be \\n sufficient for full recovery , lowering the performance of wrestlers who lose weight . \\n fast and/or higher levels of weight loss before a competition produced \\n differences in wrestlers hydration indicator levels . \\n damage in skeletal muscles of the \\n dehydrated wrestlers was greater than in those hydrated , but no difference was found in the \\n inflammation levels of the groups . if it is necessary to lose weight before a competition , \\n athletes should do it in a way to achieve a gradual and extended weight loss over a period \\n of time depending on the weight loss targeted . \\n in addition , while athletes are losing \\n weight , they should keep levels of hydration and skeletal muscle damage indicators within \\n their reference ranges through ergogenic aids . \\n thus , ergogenic aids will play a mediator \\n role for wrestlers wishing to demonstrate maximum performance and to lead a healthy \\n life .',\n",

that the serum c - rp level of the athletes decreased21. there are studies in literature of dehydration, skeletal muscle damage and inflammation among elite wrestlers22,23,24. however, no study has been conducted to determine whether skeletal muscle damage or inflammation occur with dehydration. accordingly, the present study aimed to identify weight - loss and hydration levels before competitions among elite wrestlers and explore skeletal muscle damage and inflammation levels after dehydration. trainers and athletes will benefit from information on skeletal muscle damage and inflammation levels caused by dehydration. the study subjects were 72 volunteer elite wrestlers who competed in the turkish inter - university wrestling championship a division, who had at least 5 years sport experience and did at least one exercise on a daily basis. the participant athletes were asked not to use any kinds of medicine or ergogenic aids within 48 hours before competition - weighing in order to ensure standardization of the subjects and those who used medicines or ergogenic aids were excluded from the study. during the study period, no disease that could affect the blood values of the athletes was detected, but three athletes were excluded from the study because their ck levels were above 1,000 u / l ( hyper - responder ) and their values were considered as lost data. the study was completed with 69 elite wrestlers ( 22.512.49 years, 174.546.59 cm, 78.9815.87 kg and bmi 25.733.77 the details of dehydration protocols ( how long, between which time - periods, with what methods the elite wrestlers achieved weight - loss ) were datails of dehydration protocols. wrestlers reported that they lost weight 17 days before competitions through food and fluid restrictions, sauna and exhausting exercises. in the literature, euhydration is accepted to have a reference range of 280290 mosm / l. thus, wrestlers with posm 290 were assigned to the dehydrated group and those with posm > 290 to the not dehydrated group25. dehydration was calculated using the formula below : posm = ( 2 * na)+(bun/2.8)+(glucose/18)26. determined 1% of dehydration as satisfactory dehydration, > 13% of dehydration as mild dehydration, > 35% of dehydration as high dehydration, and > 5% of dehydration as severe dehydration27. the percentage of body weight - loss ( pbwl ) calculation was performed using the formula below : body weight change=[(pre - body weight post - body weight)/pre - body weight ] 100. with the help of specialists, 5 cc of blood was drawn from the forearm veins of the participant wrestlers into 8.5 ml tubes of a vacuatiner blood collection system at the competition place and at the weighing time ( one day before the competition, between 06:00 and 06:30 pm ) and transported to the laboratory for centrifugation. the blood samples were centrifuged with a nve nf-400 for 5 minutes at 4,000 rpm. for each athlete, serums extracted from blood was preserved in two different eppendorf tubes under 20 c until the time of analysis. on the day of the analysis biochemical analyses [ hydration indicators ( na, bun, glucose ) and analyses of skeletal muscle damage indicators ( ast, alt, ldh, ck ) ] were performed using a beckman coulter au2700 plus biochemical auto - analyzer with beckman coulter kits, while hormone analyses were roche hitachi cobas e601 auto - analyzer with roche kits. c - rp analyses were performed using a beckman coulter immage 800 nephelometer autoanalyzer with roche kits. the independent samples t test was used to compare pairwise group variables that followed a normal distribution, and anova was used for more than two groups. following variance analyses ; lsd multiple comparison test was employed in order to detect which measurement results caused the differences. the responses to the questionnaire show that 55.07% of the elite wrestlers underwent fast weight - loss just before the competition ( 17 days ) ( 4.55%1.87 ). the wrestlers who underwent fast weight - loss had higher levels of posm ( 296.053.14 ) above the upper limit of reference value ( over 290 ) and suffered from dehydration. when intergroup hydration indicators were assessed, it was found that the na, bun and pbwl levels of the wrestlers who were dehydrated were higher than those of the wrestlers who were not dehydrated ( p<0.05 ), but no differences existed between the groups in terms of glucose levels ( p>0.05 ;

thus, glucose inhibition occurring with high plasma and free fat acids suggest that the damage to the muscles of the wrestlers would continue40, 41. in clinical practice, ck, ldh, ast, alt were commonly used for the diagnosis of skeletal muscle diseases and skeletal muscle tissue damage42. the ldh level is accepted to be a specific indicator of fatigue44, 45. ast, being a cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzyme, may increase in many clinical disorders, but alt has been reported to be a specific indicator of liver damage13. in our study, serum ck and ldh levels, important damage indicators, were higher in the dehydrated group than in the not dehydrated group. among the dehydrated wrestlers, the high level of serum ck would have affected their performance negatively as well as restricted their movements because of muscle pains. it is also possible that the high level of serum ldh may cause wrestlers to be reluctant and/or unwilling for the next exercise. when aminotransferases were investigated, levels of ast and alt were increased. however, while there was a significant difference in ast levels, no significant difference was seen in alt level, which demonstrates that ast exists in higher amounts in skeletal muscles than alt. serum levels of all these damage indicators reduced after exercises and correlated with relaxation and feeding after exercises46. all of the participant wrestlers reported that they did daily exercises and training. therefore ; it is our opinion that the high level of skeletal muscle damage among the dehydrated wrestlers was caused by food and fluid restriction following exercises. c - rp is a major acute phase reactant that increases acutely and quickly in response to tissue damage and infection47. in a systematic study of c - rp, it was found that as an acute phase response, c - rp temporally increased after a single exercise protocol among trained athletes. however, in prospective studies, it was demonstrated that c - rp ( pretest - posttest ) levels of the exercise groups reduced. in other words : although physical activity increased c - rp levels, chronic physical exercises reduced c - rp levels48. c - rp levels of the participant athletes of both groups were low and no difference existed between the groups. considering the fact that these athletes had a sportive experience of at least five years, it was expected that they would have increased tissue oxygenation because of having regularly exercised for years. uww ( united world wrestling ) shortened the resting - time in competitions of the wrestling championships, aiming at muscle endurance among the wrestlers. in a wrestling tournament, the qualifications, semi - finals and even finals, time between bouts will be short, and resting - time not be sufficient for full recovery, lowering the performance of wrestlers who lose weight. fast and/or higher levels of weight loss before a competition produced differences in wrestlers hydration indicator levels. damage in skeletal muscles of the dehydrated wrestlers was greater than in those hydrated, but no difference was found in the inflammation levels of the groups. if it is necessary to lose weight before a competition, athletes should do it in a way to achieve a gradual and extended weight loss over a period of time depending on the weight loss targeted. in addition, while athletes are losing weight, they should keep levels of hydration and skeletal muscle damage indicators within their reference ranges through ergogenic aids. thus, ergogenic aids will play a mediator role for wrestlers wishing to demonstrate maximum performance and to lead a healthy life.'},\n",

generating pathway is the futile cycle of proton pumping in brown fat and beige fat through the actions of uncoupling protein 1 ( ucp1 ) ( 2,3 ) . in cells expressing ucp1 , the oxidation of lipids and carbohydrates results in the extraction of high - energy electrons , which flow down the electron transport chain ( etc ) as protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane ( fig . \\n the resulting electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane , which is usually coupled to atp synthesis via complex v of the etc , is dissipated by a  leak  of protons back across the inner membrane by ucp1 . \\n thus , much of the chemical energy generated by fuel oxidation in brown fat cells powers a futile proton cycle , which does no work and is instead liberated as heat . \\n this process is typically thought of as being indirectly activated by cold , via the sympathetic nervous system ( sns ) . \\n adaptive thermogenesis can also be activated directly by cold in beige adipocytes and by other stimuli that may signal independently from the -adrenergic receptors . \\n the reducing equivalents generated by the tricarboxylic acid ( tca ) cycle enter the etc . \\n this generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane . instead of linking this gradient to atp synthesis via complex v , \\n it is also worth noting that , from a thermodynamic perspective , there is nothing special about proton cycling , and such a thermogenic machine could , in theory , be built from other components of cellular metabolism . \\n indeed , some deep - diving fish have a  heater organ ,  which is a specialized muscle that entirely lacks a myofibrillar apparatus . \\n this organ , found between the eye and brain in deep - diving marlin and certain tuna , uses a futile cycle of calcium leaking from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and atp - dependent calcium uptake to raise the local temperature near the brain of the fish ( 4 ) . in this case , the physiological goal is not to warm the whole body of the marlin , but to just make it a bit more astute than the other fish around it ! is ucp1 the only thermogenic pathway of importance in mammals ? while no other pathway of thermogenesis except shivering has been convincingly demonstrated , suggestive data from the scientific literature hints that such pathways probably exist . if mice lacking ucp1 are abruptly switched from ambient temperatures to cold ( 4c ) , they develop life - threatening hypothermia ( 5 ) . on the other hand , \\n if they are gradually exposed to lower temperatures , they can survive quite normally at 4c ( 6 ) . \\n this suggests that there are compensatory thermogenic programs that can be activated as long as thermal stress is applied more gradually . \\n in addition , there are examples of experiments in mice where certain mutations have caused very robust increases in energy expenditure and thermogenesis , but where the levels of ucp1 mrna and protein are unchanged . \\n for example , deletion of par-1b / mark2 in mice results in increased energy expenditure and brown fat activation , although ucp1 protein levels were unchanged ( 7 ) . \\n ucp1 brown fat has long been known to occur in two distinct anatomical locations in rodents . \\n developmentally formed depots , best typified by the interscapular and perirenal regions , are composed of tightly packed brown fat cells of relatively uniform appearance . \\n these depots exist under most physiological conditions , although they may change in color and lipid content . on the other hand \\n , ucp1 cells can accumulate in small pockets in white fat depots , especially in the subcutaneous adipose tissues , particularly when mice are exposed to long - term cold or stimuli with hormones such as catecholamines and other -adrenergic agonists ( 8) . this pathway of adaptive thermogenesis is robustly activated by cold via an indirect pathway mediated by the sympathetic nervous system . \\n however , fat cells are also able to directly sense cold , though the mechanism is not well understood ( 9 ) . in both anatomical situations , brown fat cells have multiple small lipid droplets , numerous mitochondria , and rich innervation and vascularization . despite these similarities , it is now clear that the  classical  brown fat cells and the inducible  beige  fat cells come from different developmental lineages and are , in fact , distinct cell types . \\n the key finding in this regard was the observation that the classical developmentally formed brown fat arises from a myf5 lineage shared with skeletal muscle ( 10 ) . \\n consistent with this , primary cultures of classical brown fat express low levels of certain genes characteristic of skeletal muscle ( 11 ) . \\n subsequent work indicated that the brown fat / skeletal muscle decision occurs between 9.5 and 12.5 days of gestation in mice ( 12 ) . \\n conversely , the ucp1 cells induced in subcutaneous white fat depots by cold or -adrenergic agonists come from a myf5 lineage ( 10 ) . these beige fat cells have now been cloned and express a relatively low level of thermogenic genes , such as ucp1 and type 2 deiodinase in the basal state , but can induce these genes to levels essentially equivalent to classical brown fat cells when given hormonal stimuli ( 13 ) . moreover , \\n the beige and brown fat cells have gene signatures that allow for distinction of these cells types ; however , their comparative physiological properties and overall roles in metabolism are not completely understood . \\n it is now clear that thermogenic adipocytes , taken as a whole , contribute very importantly to metabolic homeostasis in rodents . \\n the partial ablation of ucp1 cells through the transgenic expression of a toxigene led to these animals being more susceptible to obesity and diabetes ( 14 ) . \\n similarly , mice lacking ucp1 through targeted mutation had an increased body weight and fat content , at least when raised at thermoneutrality ( 15 ) . \\n excessive shivering apparently prevented obesity when these experiments were performed at ambient temperatures . the first transgenic model with increased brown and beige \\n fat was the adipose - selective expression of foxc2 , a transcription factor that activated camp metabolism in recipient cells ( 16 ) . \\n these mice , which were resistant to diet - induced obesity and diabetes , had expansions of both the classical brown and beige fat . deciphering the individual roles of brown and beige fat cells \\n prd1-bf-1-riz1 homologous domain - containing protein-16 ( prdm16 ) is an important transcriptional coregulator in both brown and beige fat , but when its expression was elevated through a promoter expressed in all fat depots ( ap2 ) , phenotypic changes were observed in the erstwhile white fat depots , which developed copious pockets of beige fat cells ( 17,18 ) . \\n the classical brown fat , which expresses very high levels of prdm16 in the basal state , showed few or no changes with a further elevation in prdm16 expression . \\n but this occurred only when the transgenic mice also received stimulation with a -adrenergic agonist . while studies in cultured cells had shown that classical brown fat cells require prdm16 to develop and maintain a thermogenic gene program , ablation of prdm16 from all fat cells in vivo was not sufficient to significantly alter the function of the classical brown fat . on the other hand , \\n the development of beige fat cells was severely reduced , at both the histological and molecular level ( 19 ) . \\n these mice developed a moderate obesity , compared with control animals , with an unusual expansion of the subcutaneous fat depots . \\n these beige fat  deficient mice also showed a rather profound hepatic insulin resistance that was associated with liver steatosis . \\n one last point of interest is that the subcutaneous fat from the prdm16-ablated mice showed the presence of more inflammatory macrophages and increased the expression of proinflammatory genes . \\n the latter aspect was also observed with cultured subcutaneous cells lacking prdm16 , indicating that this transcriptional coregulator plays a role in the relative resistance of subcutaneous fat to inflammation and is an important determinant of subcutaneous versus visceral fat phenotype . \\n the role of prdm16 in the classical brown fat in vivo is interesting and somewhat more complex . \\n ablation of this factor with a myf5-driven cre recombinase causes a loss of brown fat function and gene expression , but only at 6 months of age ( 20 ) . \\n however , ablation of prdm16 along with its closest homolog , prdm3 , causes an early and severe loss of brown fat thermogenic gene expression and normal histology . \\n thus , it appears that both thermogenic cell types depend on prdm16 , but , at least in early life , the classical brown fat has a second factor that can support development , prdm3 . \\n harnessing the therapeutic potential of brown and beige fat requires a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the determination and maintenance of each cell type . \\n the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator  activated receptor  ( ppar ) is necessary and sufficient for the development of all fat cells ( 21 ) . \\n however , white and brown adipocytes have drastically different phenotypes , indicating that other transcriptional regulators must be involved . \\n a yeast two - hybrid screen identified ppar coactivator-1 ( pgc-1 ) as a cold - inducible binding partner of ppar ( 22 ) . in brown fat \\n pgc-1 is now appreciated to regulate numerous physiological processes in a variety of metabolically important tissues . \\n while brown and beige fat cells lacking pgc-1 have significantly blunted thermogenic gene expression , these cells still retain the molecular signature of brown fat cells ( 23,24 ) . \\n the transcriptional regulator prdm16 was found to be highly enriched in brown fat , whereas it is virtually undetectable in visceral white fat cells . \\n forced expression of prdm16 in cultured white fat cells induces pgc-1 and thermogenic genes , as well as mitochondrial genes and brown fat identity genes ( 17 ) . \\n in addition to activating these pathways , prdm16 also binds ccaat / enhancer binding protein  ( c / ebp ) and recruits the corepressor proteins ctbp1 and ctbp2 to repress white fat or muscle gene expression ( 25 ) . \\n importantly , the expression of prdm16 and its binding partner c / ebp in fibroblasts is sufficient to promote differentiation into functional brown fat cells , which can be detected by [ f]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy - d - glucose ( [ f]-fdg ) positron emission tomography ( pet ) when transplanted into mouse models ( 26 ) . \\n an increasing number of transcriptional regulators has been identified as important in brown and beige fat biology . \\n the transcription factor early b - cell factor-2 ( ebf2 ) is enriched in brown relative to beige adipocytes . \\n it functions upstream of prdm16 to promote binding of ppar to the promoters of brown - selective genes ( 27 ) . \\n ehmt1 is a histone lysine methyltransferase that purifies with the prdm16 transcriptional complex in brown fat . \\n ehmt1 is required for brown fat lineage specification and for thermogenesis ( 28 ) . presumably , there are also beige - selective factors upstream of prdm16 and beige - selective epigenetic regulators that modulate the phenotype of these cells . \\n it is able to compete with prdm16 for binding to ppar , and thereby modulates white versus brown / beige phenotype ( 29,30 ) . forced expression of tle3 in adipocytes results in impaired thermogenesis , while deletion enhances thermogenesis in brown and beige fat . \\n a number of other factors have also been shown to play roles in this biology , but a comprehensive review is beyond the scope of this article . \\n until fairly recently , brown fat was thought to be present in meaningful amounts only in human infants and small mammals . \\n the combination of insufficient hair , fur , and insulation , along with a high body surface area - to - mass ratio make babies and small mammals particularly susceptible to hypothermia . as a result \\n , they have developed significant interscapular brown fat , which defends body temperature by adaptive thermogenesis . \\n this brown fat was thought to regress by adulthood , unless exposed to catecholamine excess ( as in pheochromocytoma ) or long - term cold exposure ( as in outdoor workers in cold climates ) . in 2009 , \\n these studies made use of [ f]-fdg pet to confirm that adults have glucose - avid tissue with imaging characteristics of adipose in deposits in the supraclavicular and spinal regions . as assayed by [ f]-fdg pet , \\n the amount of  active  tissue is inversely associated with bmi , and this activity is increased by cold exposure . \\n follow - up studies ( 34 ) have shown that this tissue has the histological appearance of adipose tissue and expresses several molecular markers of brown fat including ucp1 . \\n current efforts are focused on developing optimal imaging modalities to detect this tissue and to quantify its absolute amounts and activity . \\n this is particularly important since brown and beige fat also oxidize lipids , which would not be detectable by [ f]-fdg pet technology . \\n research has increasingly suggested that adult human brown fat shares features of the inducible beige fat described in rodents . \\n brown and beige fat cell lines have now been cloned from mice , allowing for the identification of unique molecular markers of each cell type . \\n multiple studies ( 13,35,36 ) have shown that beige - selective markers are expressed more in human brown fat samples than are markers of the classical brown fat of rodents . a very recent study ( 37 ) characterized a human brown fat cell line and showed that it actually shares more molecular features with beige than brown adipocytes . \\n however , the brown fat in human infants , located in the interscapular region , seems most similar to the interscapular classical brown fat in rodents . in some adult humans , cells with both brown and beige characteristics \\n have been identified , with the depth in the neck seeming to be a determinant of relative brown versus beige character ( 36,38,39 ) . while further studies will clarify this question , \\n this tissue may well contain both brown and beige cells in varying amounts in each individual . \\n as a deeper understanding of brown and beige fat has emerged , researchers have turned to strategies to induce the activity of these tissues as a possible therapy for obesity and metabolic diseases . \\n calculations have suggested that maximal cold - induced brown fat thermogenesis would be between 25 and 400 kcal / day in lean healthy volunteers ( 40 ) . \\n given the inducibility of beige fat , activating these cells could result in even more substantial effects . \\n however , the greatest benefits may not relate to increased energy expenditure per se , but rather might result from enhanced glucose and lipid disposal . \\n in addition to taking up and consuming glucose ( 3133 ) , brown adipose tissue takes up free fatty acids from triglyceride - rich lipoproteins . \\n cold exposure in mice upregulates this pathway , resulting in accelerated plasma triglyceride clearance ( 41 ) . \\n while compounds like dinitrophenol can result in impressive weight loss , they have also been associated with complications , including fatal hyperthermia . while this has understandably resulted in caution , it is possible that more specific uncouplers or targeted activators of ucp1 or other futile cycles may provide metabolic benefit with an acceptable safety profile . in that regard , \\n a recent publication ( 42 ) described the development of controlled - release mitochondrial protonophores that can apparently safely uncouple in the liver , and in rats these compounds can improve insulin resistance , diabetes , hypertriglyceridemia , and hepatic steatosis . \\n brown and beige fat activity is robustly induced by thyroid hormone and catecholamines , but side effects would almost certainly limit their use . the 3-selective adrenergic agonist cl 316,243 potently activates brown and beige fat in rodents ( 43 ) . \\n this drug was recently shown to activate human brown fat , which may renew interest in this pathway ( 44 ) . \\n since cold robustly activates brown and beige fat , some investigators have suggested that moderate cold exposure could be used as a therapeutic approach . at least in healthy subjects , daily exposure to 19c for 2 h was sufficient to activate brown fat , resulting in weight loss ( 45 ) . in another small human study ( 46 ) \\n while these studies suggest the potential of cold as a treatment modality , our societal preference for thermal comfort may make this unfeasible as a broad approach . \\n thiazolidinediones ( tzds ) cause browning of the white fat and may do so by stabilizing prdm16 , resulting in its accumulation ( 47 ) . however , these drugs have been associated with weight gain , fluid retention , and cardiovascular events , which have diminished enthusiasm for their use . \\n deacetylation of ppar by sirt1 promotes browning of the white fat , suggesting the possibility of developing compounds that selectively modulate this pathway ( 48 ) . \\n other regulators of interest include bone morphogenetic protein 7 ( bmp7 ) and bmp8b , cyclooxygenase-2 ( cox-2 ) , and natriuretic peptides , though their pleiotropic actions might limit their potential as drug targets . \\n fibroblast growth factor 21 ( fgf21 ) is being examined as a therapeutic agent , but it also has diverse actions and may be associated with bone loss . translating these discoveries into drug candidates will ultimately require a more complete understanding of brown / beige fat biology in humans . \\n mouse studies suggest that prdm16 is a key control point in brown and beige fat phenotype . \\n an increasing understanding of the relevant modifications of prdm16 and the upstream signaling pathways involved may provide new opportunities for therapeutic targeting of brown and beige fat .',\n",

extraction of high-energy electrons, which flow down the electron transport chain (etc) as protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane (fig. the resulting electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is usually coupled to atp synthesis via complex v of the etc, is dissipated by a leak of protons back across the inner membrane by ucp1. thus, much of the chemical energy generated by fuel oxidation in brown fat cells powers a futile proton cycle, which does no work and is instead liberated as heat. this process is typically thought of as being indirectly activated by cold, via the sympathetic nervous system (sns). adaptive thermogenesis can also be activated directly by cold in beige adipocytes and by other stimuli that may signal independently from the -adrenergic receptors. the reducing equivalents generated by the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle enter the etc. this generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. instead of linking this gradient to atp synthesis via complex v, it is also worth noting that, from a thermodynamic perspective, there is nothing special about proton cycling, and such a thermogenic machine could, in theory, be built from other components of cellular metabolism. indeed, some deep-diving fish have a heater organ, which is a specialized muscle that entirely lacks a myofibrillar apparatus. this organ, found between the eye and brain in deep-diving marlin and certain tuna, uses a futile cycle of calcium leaking from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and atp-dependent calcium uptake to raise the local temperature near the brain of the fish (4). in this case, the physiological goal is not to warm the whole body of the marlin, but to just make it a bit more astute than the other fish around it! is ucp1 the only thermogenic pathway of importance in mammals? while no other pathway of thermogenesis except shivering has been convincingly demonstrated, suggestive data from the scientific literature hints that such pathways probably exist. if mice lacking ucp1 are abruptly switched from ambient temperatures to cold (4c), they develop life-threatening hypothermia (5). on the other hand, if they are gradually exposed to lower temperatures, they can survive quite normally at 4c (6). this suggests that there are compensatory thermogenic programs that can be activated as long as thermal stress is applied more gradually. in addition, there are examples of experiments in mice where certain mutations have caused very robust increases in energy expenditure and thermogenesis, but where the levels of ucp1 mrna and protein are unchanged. for example, deletion of par-1b/mark2 in mice results in increased energy expenditure and brown fat activation, although ucp1 protein levels were unchanged (7). ucp1 brown fat has long been known to occur in two distinct anatomical locations in rodents. developmentally formed depots, best typified by the interscapular and perirenal regions, are composed of tightly packed brown fat cells of relatively uniform appearance. these depots exist under most physiological conditions, although they may change in color and lipid content. on the other hand, ucp1 cells can accumulate in small pockets in white fat depots, especially in the subcutaneous adipose tissues, particularly when mice are exposed to long-term cold or stimuli with hormones such as catecholamines and other-adrenergic agonists (8). this pathway of adaptive thermogenesis is robustly activated by cold via an indirect pathway mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. however, fat cells are also able to directly sense cold, though the mechanism is not well understood (9). in both anatomical situations, brown fat cells have multiple small lipid droplets, numerous mitochondria, and rich innervation and vascularization. despite these similarities, it is now clear that the classical brown fat cells and the inducible beige fat cells come from different developmental lineages and are, in fact, distinct cell types. the key finding in this regard was the observation that the classical developmentally formed brown fat arises from a myf5 lineage shared with skeletal muscle (10). consistent with this, primary cultures of classical brown fat express low levels of certain genes characteristic of skeletal muscle (11). subsequent work indicated that the brown fat/skeletal muscle decision occurs between 9.5 and 12.5 days of gestation in mice (12). conversely, the ucp1 cells induced in subcutaneous white fat depots by cold or-adrenergic agonists come from a myf5 lineage (10). these beige fat cells have now been cloned and express a relatively low level of thermogenic genes, such as ucp1 and type 2 deiodinase in the basal state, but can induce these genes to levels essentially equivalent to classical brown fat cells when given hormonal stimuli (13). moreover, the beige and brown fat cells have gene signatures that allow for distinction of these cells types; however, their comparative physiological properties and overall roles in metabolism are not completely understood. it is now clear that thermogenic adipocytes, taken as a whole, contribute very importantly to metabolic homeostasis in rodents. the partial ablation of ucp1 cells through the transgenic expression of a toxigene led to these animals being more susceptible to obesity and diabetes (14). similarly, mice lacking ucp1 through targeted mutation had an increased body weight and fat content, at least when raised at thermoneutrality (15). excessive shivering apparently prevented obesity when these experiments were performed at ambient temperatures. the first transgenic model with increased brown and beige fat was the adipose-selective expression of foxc2, a transcription factor that activated camp metabolism in recipient cells (16). these mice, which were resistant to diet-induced obesity and diabetes, had expansions of both the classical brown and beige fat. deciphering the individual roles of brown and beige fat cells prd1-bf-1-riz1 homologous domain-containing protein-16 (prdm16) is an important transcriptional coregulator in both brown and beige fat, but when its expression was elevated through a promoter expressed in all fat depots (ap2), phenotypic changes were observed in the erstwhile white fat depots, which developed copious pockets of beige fat cells (17,18). the classical brown fat, which expresses very high levels of prdm16 in the basal state, showed few or no changes with a further elevation in prdm16 expression. while studies in cultured cells had shown that classical brown fat cells require prdm16 to develop and maintain a thermogenic gene program, ablation of prdm16 from all fat cells in vivo was not sufficient to significantly alter the function of the classical brown fat. on the other hand, the development of beige fat cells was severely reduced, at both the histological and molecular level (19). these mice developed a moderate obesity, compared with control animals, with an unusual expansion of the subcutaneous fat depots. these beige fat deficient mice also showed a rather profound hepatic insulin resistance that was associated with liver steatosis. one last point of interest is that the subcutaneous fat from the prdm16-ablated mice showed the presence of more inflammatory macrophages and increased the expression of proinflammatory genes. the latter aspect was also observed with cultured subcutaneous cells lacking prdm16, indicating that this transcriptional coregulator plays a role in the relative resistance of subcutaneous fat to inflammation and is an important determinant of subcutaneous versus visceral fat phenotype. the role of prdm16 in the classical brown fat in vivo is interesting and somewhat more complex. ablation of this factor with a myf5-driven cre recombinase causes a loss of brown fat function and gene expression, but only at 6 months of age (20). however, ablation of prdm16 along with its closest homolog, prdm3, causes an early and severe loss of brown fat thermogenic gene expression and normal histology. thus, it appears that both thermogenic cell types depend on prdm16, but, at least in early life, the classical brown fat has a second factor that can support development, prdm3. harnessing the therapeutic potential of brown and beige fat requires a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the determination and maintenance of each cell type. the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (ppar) is necessary and sufficient for the development of all fat cells (21). however, white and brown adipocytes have drastically different phenotypes, indicating that other transcriptional regulators must be involved. a yeast two-hybrid screen identified ppar coactivator-1 (pgc-1) as a cold-inducible binding partner of ppar (22). in brown fat pgc-1 is now appreciated to regulate numerous physiological processes in a variety of metabolically important tissues. while brown and beige fat cells lacking pgc-1 have significantly blunted thermogenic gene expression, these cells still retain the molecular signature of brown fat cells (23,24). the transcriptional regulator prdm16 was found to be highly enriched in brown fat, whereas it is virtually undetectable in visceral white fat cells. forced expression of prdm16 in cultured white fat cells induces pgc-1 and thermogenic genes, as well as mitochondrial genes and brown fat identity genes (17). in addition to activating these pathways, prdm16 also binds ccaat/enhancer binding protein (c/ebp) and recruits the corepressor proteins ctbp1 and ctbp2 to repress white fat or muscle gene expression (25). importantly, the expression of prdm16 and its binding partner c/ebp in fibroblasts is sufficient to promote differentiation into functional brown fat cells, which can be detected by [f]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([f]-fdg) positron emission tomography (pet) when transplanted into mouse models (26). an increasing number of transcriptional regulators has been identified as important in brown and beige fat biology. the transcription factor early b-cell factor-2 (ebf2) is enriched in brown relative to beige adipocytes. it functions upstream of prdm16 to promote binding of ppar to the promoters of brown-selective genes (27). ehmt1 is a histone lysine methyltransferase that purifies with the prdm16 transcriptional complex in brown fat. ehmt1 is required for brown fat lineage specification and for thermogenesis (28). presumably, there are also beige-selective factors upstream of prdm16 and beige-selective epigenetic regulators that modulate the phenotype of these cells. it is able to compete with prdm16 for binding to ppar, and thereby modulates white versus brown/beige phenotype (29,30). forced expression of tle3 in adipocytes results in impaired thermogenesis, while deletion enhances thermogenesis in brown and beige fat. a number of other factors have also been shown to play roles in this biology, but a comprehensive review is beyond the scope of this article. translating these discoveries into drug candidates will ultimately require a more complete understanding of brown/beige fat biology in humans. mouse studies suggest that prdm16 is a key control point in brown and beige fat phenotype. an increasing understanding of the relevant modifications of prdm16 and the upstream signaling pathways involved may provide new opportunities for therapeutic targeting of brown and beige fat.'},\n",

cause hospitalizations . \\n our study extends these findings , and we demonstrate an association of fructosamine with all - cause and cvd mortality as well as cvd events and sepsis hospitalizations . \\n the association between glycated albumin and outcomes in dialysis patients with diabetes has been previously evaluated in two single -

( 28 ) analyzed the outcomes of 98 diabetic patients on hemodialysis during 19922003 at shigei medical research hospital ( okayama , japan ) . \\n they found that glycated albumin was associated with all - cause mortality [ hr per 1% increase , 1.04 ( 95% ci 1.011.07 ) ; p = 0.003 ] but not infectious or cvd death . \\n freedman et al . ( 17 ) recently reported the outcomes of 444 incident and prevalent dialysis patients ( 401 hemodialysis ) treated at the wake forest university  affiliated dialysis units in north carolina during january to june 2007 . \\n the updated mean of up to 6.09 glycated albumin measurements was associated with all - cause mortality [ adjusted hr per 5% increase , 1.12 ( 0.991.27 ) ; p = 0.07 ] and hospitalization [ hr per 5% increase , 1.02 ( 1.011.04 ) ] , whereas a single measurement of hba1c at baseline was not significantly associated with all - cause mortality or hospitalization risk in this population . \\n no prior studies have compared the associations of fructosamine and glycated albumin with long - term outcomes in a national dialysis cohort in the u.s . in our study \\n , we found that both fructosamine and glycated albumin were similarly robust in predicting outcomes in dialysis patients with and without diabetes . \\n this association between hyperglycemia and mortality in dialysis patients without diabetes has not been shown previously , but our results are generally consistent with the findings from studies of nondialysis populations ( 29,30 ) . in our study , \\n higher fructosamine was associated with higher serum albumin and total protein levels , whereas higher glycated albumin was associated with lower serum albumin levels . adjusting for albumin or total protein \\n serum fructosamine represents the total glycated serum proteins , whereas glycated albumin is expressed as a ratio of glycated albumin to total albumin . as a result , the changes in serum protein concentration are likely to have a greater impact on serum fructosamine than glycated albumin . because of \\n possible effect modification by diabetes status , we conducted analyses overall and stratified by a diagnosis of diabetes . however , as diabetes may be associated with macrovascular disease prior to esrd , adjusting for diabetes may control for some residual confounding that may have existed in the overall model . \\n adjustment for diabetes ( supplementary tables 1 and 2 , model 3 ) attenuated the association between markers and outcomes , but the magnitude and direction of effect remain unchanged . \\n first , stored samples were only available for 66% of the choice hemodialysis cohort , which could have introduced a selection bias with inclusion of healthier participants compared with the full cohort . \\n second , hba1c measurements were only available in a subsample of participants with diagnosed diabetes . however , in analyses limited to the participants with hba1c data , the direction and magnitude of the associations of fructosamine and glycated albumin on mortality were similar to results in the total cohort , although power to detect associations in this subsample was limited due to the small sample size . \\n third , we only had single measurements of fructosamine and glycated albumin , which may be associated with significant within - person variability , particularly in a dialysis population . \\n fourth , the diagnosis of diabetes was based on self - report and available medical records and was not confirmed by oral glucose tolerance testing . as a result , individuals with undiagnosed diabetes were not classified as diabetes cases in this study . finally , we only had information about diabetes medications at baseline and do not have information about the occurrence of hypoglycemia or discontinuation of therapy , which could have effects on outcomes . nonetheless , this study has several strengths , including the prospective design , detailed information on demographic , clinical , and treatment factors , and systematic adjudication of baseline comorbid conditions as well as incident events . \\n these comprehensive data allowed us to extensively adjust for numerous rigorously measured a priori defined potential confounders . in summary , we found that both serum fructosamine and glycated albumin were risk factors for all - cause and cvd mortality , cvd events , and sepsis hospitalizations in hemodialysis patients . \\n the measurement of these markers may be useful for the management of diabetes in dialysis patients .',\n",

       "  'input': 'monitoring the bioenergetic health of immune cells ( monocytes , lymphocytes , neutrophils ) and platelets from blood has been recognized for some time as a potentially useful diagnostic tool to assess the overall bioenergetic health of an individual . \\n there is an emerging body of literature attributing a number of diseases such as cancer , cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases to mitochondrial dysfunction . \\n this is clinically important since mitochondrial dysfunction can initiate a series of cellular events that promote pro - inflammatory signaling pathways or lead to cell death . \\n several studies have characterized mitochondrial function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and platelets in conditions such as fibromyalgia , diabetes , septic shock , and alzheimer s disease . \\n for example , a recent study evaluated the bioenergetics of platelets as a marker for mitochondrial function and found that platelets from type 2 diabetic patients had diminished mitochondrial oxygen consumption . from these findings and others , it is clear that monocytes , lymphocytes , neutrophils , and platelets can serve as surrogate markers of changes in bioenergetics under pathological conditions since they survey the systemic circulation and may reflect local and global metabolic changes . to determine whether this approach has prognostic or diagnostic value a high throughput method of analysis and a consistent method for cell preparation is required . \\n the methods to measure mitochondrial function in leukocytes and platelets have previously involved isolation of mitochondria or assessment of cellular bioenergetics in intact cells . \\n the advantage of cellular bioenergetic assessment using an extracellular flux ( xf ) analyzer is that the mitochondrial function in cells can be established with endogenous substrates and respiratory parameters such as proton leak and maximal respiratory capacity can be determined . \\n we and others have used this technology to show that bioenergetic profiles in platelets , monocytes and lymphocytes isolated from human blood can be established and compared among cell types . \\n in addition , both neutrophils and monocytes possess an oxidative burst capacity in which napdh oxidases are activated and consume oxygen to form superoxide . \\n importantly , this pathway is a key component of innate immunity and is modulated by systemic inflammation . \\n for example , it has been shown that changes in the oxidative burst capacity are associated with various autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis , arthritis , and recurrent infections . \\n currently there are no high throughput quantitative assays available to measure the oxidative burst in clinical samples . \\n this is important since characterizing the oxidative burst capacity of neutrophils and monocytes may also serve as an important diagnostic tool for several pathologies . \\n the key technical challenges have been low sensitivity for measurement of oxygen consumption using conventional polarographic techniques and the need to use attached cells when using more sensitive microplate fluorometric techniques .  in this practical video , \\n we detail the methods for the isolation , plating and measurement of bioenergetics of monocytes , lymphocytes , neutrophils , and platelets and the oxidative burst of monocytes and neutrophils from human blood . \\n this method is suitable for clinical assessment of bioenergetics and oxidative burst for investigators that have access to a patient population and the capability to obtain fresh blood samples . \\n all protocols described in this manuscript for blood collection , isolation and analysis have been reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at the university of alabama at birmingham . \\n centrifuge whole blood ( collected in acd or edta tubes ) at 500 x g for 15 min  in a centrifuge with a swinging -

through from the monocytes contain lymphocytes , which are then depleted of rbcs and platelets . \\n the neutrophils are obtained by incubation of the polymorphonuclear cell layer with cd15 antibody ( figure 1a ) . \\n thereafter , the platelets can be pelleted by centrifugation of the platelet rich plasma and washed to remove other plasma components . \\n after these selections the platelets , cd14 + monocytes , lymphocytes , cd15 + neutrophils can be counted and plated on a cell adhesion medium - coated xf analyzer plate for bioenergetics and oxidative burst analysis . \\n each stage of the procedure should be performed in sterile conditions and is encouraged to prevent the premature activation of the oxidative burst response in monocytes and neutrophils . \\n an indicator of less than sterile conditions during the isolation is evident when neutrophils , which have little to no oxygen consumption under basal conditions , begin the extracellular flux assay with elevated ocr measurements that gradually increase or decline throughout the assay . \\n we stress the importance of imaging cells using light microscopy at 200x  or greater to ensure that no morphological signs of activation have occurred prior to the assay . for example \\n , neutrophils normally display a rounded to irregular shape with pronounced cell boundaries as seen in figure 1b . \\n however , these cells will flatten against the surface of the plate when activated and lose their distinct cell morphology . \\n we have previously reported the morphological changes of activated leukocytes and platelets using this protocol and additional measures must be taken to ensure sterile conditions if encountering activation . \\n a simplified scheme of the protocol is seen in figure 2 as a time table in which the primary steps of the cell isolation , xf plate preparation , and xf assay are detailed . \\n isolation consists of the density gradient separation of cell types and is followed by magnetic separation . \\n parallel to the cell isolation process , xf plate preparation is necessary to avoid delays in cell plating or beginning the xf assay . \\n this is critical because significant delays can lead to cell activation and diminished bioenergetics parameters . \\n inadequate cell concentrations after isolation are a common problem and optimization of each centrifugation process is necessary to avoid cell loss . \\n successful isolations have been performed on as little as 6 ml of blood but alterations can be made depending on circulating concentrations of the desired cell type . \\n if the density gradient is improperly prepared , distinct cell phases might not be visible and loss of cells can occur ( see jove instructional video for a visual demonstration ) . \\n insufficient platelet isolated from the prp is rare but has occurred if washing buffer does not contain pgi2 or if the isolation takes place below room temperature . \\n the risk of platelet activation is often prevented if platelets are the last cells to be isolated ; however , if platelets remain in washing buffer for extended periods the bioenergetics will be affected . \\n there have been instances of smaller platelet populations that did not pellet during the 1,500 x g centrifugation and the bioenergetics of these cells has not been extensively characterized . see table 2 for a more complete troubleshooting guide . \\n the bioenergetic profiles of leukocytes and platelets can be determined using the xf analyzer , which measures real -

synthase is injected into the xf medium to estimate the ocr coupled to atp synthesis and represented as atp - linked . the residual ocr minus the nonmitochondrial ocr can be attributed to proton leak . \\n then fccp an uncoupler is added to determine the maximal ocr , followed by antimycin - a , an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration , to determine nonmitochondrial sources of oxygen consumption . \\n reserve capacity is a measure of the amount of atp that can be produced under energetic demand and can be calculated as the difference between the maximum rate of respiration and the basal . in order to determine the oxidative burst capacity , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( pma ) a pkc agonist \\n is injected to increase nadph oxidase activity , and the increase in oxygen consumption rate following pma stimulation can be measured using the xf analyzer . \\n figure 4b show how to calculate the different parameters of mitochondrial function and oxidative burst . \\n figure 1.isolation of leukocytes and platelets from whole blood.a ) freshly collected specimens are separated into their plasma and cellular components by centrifugation and purified by ficoll density gradient , and magnetic activated cell sorting ( macs ) by positive ( monocyte and neutrophil ) or negative selection ( lymphocytes ) , while platelets are isolated by high -

       "  'output': 'mitochondrial dysfunction is known to play a significant role in a number of pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis , diabetes , septic shock , and neurodegenerative diseases but assessing changes in bioenergetic function in patients is challenging . \\n although diseases such as diabetes or atherosclerosis present clinically with specific organ impairment , the systemic components of the pathology , such as hyperglycemia or inflammation , can alter bioenergetic function in circulating leukocytes or platelets . \\n this concept has been recognized for some time but its widespread application has been constrained by the large number of primary cells needed for bioenergetic analysis .  this technical limitation has been overcome by combining the specificity of the magnetic bead isolation techniques , cell adhesion techniques , which allow cells to be attached without activation to microplates , and the sensitivity of new technologies designed for high throughput microplate respirometry . \\n an example of this equipment is the extracellular flux analyzer . \\n such instrumentation typically uses oxygen and ph sensitive probes to measure rates of change in these parameters in adherent cells , which can then be related to metabolism . here \\n we detail the methods for the isolation and plating of monocytes , lymphocytes , neutrophils and platelets , without activation , from human blood and the analysis of mitochondrial bioenergetic function in these cells . in addition \\n , we demonstrate how the oxidative burst in monocytes and neutrophils can also be measured in the same samples . \\n since these methods use only 8 - 20 ml human blood they have potential for monitoring reactive oxygen species generation and bioenergetics in a clinical setting .',\n",

specific inhibitor and inhibits rock activity by competitively combining atp sites of rock catalytic domain . \\n rocki and rockii were both reported . in kidney tissues , rocki is the major one presented . \\n recent studies revealed that abnormal activation of rock signaling pathway played a very important role in the pathophysiology of all kinds of complications of diabetes [ 13 , 14 ] . \\n our study confirmed that there was rock activation in renal tubular epithelium cells of 12 weeks of diabetic rats , and the effects of rock on diabetic renal interstitial space were through rock1 . \\n further study found that the protein expression of e - cadherin , the marker protein of renal tubular epithelium cells , was downregulated in diabetic rats , while the protein expression of -sma , the marker protein of myofibrillar cells , was upregulated , indicating that there was emt in diabetic nephropathy of rats . \\n benidipine or fasudil can significantly inhibit nag activity , reduce urine protein and scr level , decrease the expression of p - mypt1 , rock1 , and -sma , and increase the expression of e - cadherin without affecting blood glucose or pressure . \\n benidipine has protective effect on diabetic nephropathy of rats , independent of its effect of lowering blood pressure . \\n tcc is a low - voltage activated channel , mainly located in renal efferent arterioles and pacing cells of the heart . through its strong blocking effects on tcc , benidipine dilates renal afferent and efferent arterioles equally and thus effectively reduces the resistance of renal vessels and intrarenal pressure . \\n it is showed that , besides its effects on adjusting capillary pressure of glomerular , tcc has many nonhemodynamic effects [ 1619 ] . \\n it regulates the activity of nf - k and thus inhibits inflammation , promotes the secretion and release of aldosterone , improves the remodeling of the heart and kidney , and anti - oxygenize and anti - proliferate [ 2023 ] . \\n it is found that in the subremoval kidney models , by inhibiting rho kinase activity , selective t channel blocker improves renal interstitial fibrosis and emt . \\n however , there are limitations of our study ; the sample size was rather small , and it is a study in animals instead of human being . in summary , \\n our study is the first study suggesting that benidipine protects kidney in rats with type 1 diabetes , possibly through its effect of inhibiting rho kinase activity and thus reducing epithelium - mesenchymal transdifferentiation ( emt ) . \\n this may guide further animal studies , clinical trials on the importance of benidipine in diabetic emt development especially in type 1 diabetic , and the possible mechanism involved . from the long run \\n , it may direct the clinical use of benidipine in treating patients with diabetic nephropathy especially those in t1 dm .',\n",

transformed into normal distributed variables and then analyzed thereafter ; data were presented with median. \\n as shown in table 2, at 12 weeks, compared with n group, d group had elevated 24-hour urine protein, nag activity, scr ( p < 0.05 ), and decreased ccr ( p < 0.05 ). compared with d group, f group had decreased 24-hour urine protein, nag activity, and scr ( p < 0.05 ). there was no significant difference between f and b groups. \\n there was no significant difference for blood pressure or glucose among groups, as shown in table 3. compared with n and f groups, \\n d group had significant expanded glomerular mesangial matrix, increased cell number, thickened basement membrane, with multiple inflammatory cells infiltrated in interstitial space, dilated renal tubular, and fibrosis in interstitial space. \\n there were mild proliferation of glomerular mesangial matrix, inflammatory infiltration, tubular dilatation, and fibrosis in f and b groups, as shown in figure 1. \\n the expression of rock1 showed trace in tubular epithelium cells in n group, was enhanced in d group which mainly distributed in dilated renal tubular, and was reduced in f and b groups. \\n -sma was presented in the smooth muscle cells of renal small artery in n group and visible in epithelium of renal tubular in d group with majority expressed in medullar area but no expression in f or d group. \\n e - cadherin was mainly presented in the epithelium cells of renal tubular in n group, especially in the cell conjunction area, with partial expression for f and b groups which was enhanced at the cell junction area but no expression on tubular epithelium in d group, as shown in figure 2. as shown in figure 3, \\n compared with n group, the rats in d group had enhanced protein expressions of p - mypt1, rock1, and -sma in renal cortex but reduced e - cadherin. compared with d group, f group and b group had reduced protein expressions for p - mypt1, rock1, and -sma and enhanced e - cadherin which was still less than that of the normal group. there was no significant difference between f and b groups, as shown in figure 3 and table 4. \\n compared with n group, mrna expression of rock1 in renal cortex was increased in d group. \\n compared with d group, there was less mrna expression of rock1 in f and b groups, lower than normal, as shown in figure 4. \\n in this study, by treating rats with type 1 diabetic nephropathy with benidipine, a triple channel blocker, and fasudil, a rho kinase inhibitor, we successfully investigated the effect of benidipine on epithelium - mesenchymal transdifferentiation and its possible mechanism via inhibiting rho kinase activity. these results were consistent with some previous studies. \\n rock directly affects myosin light chain ( mlc ) or indirectly affects the target subunit of myosin phosphatase ( mypt1 ) and thus increases the phosphorylation of mlc in plasma and controls the attachment, chemoattractant, contraction, and so forth. \\n fasudil is a rock - specific inhibitor and inhibits rock activity by competitively combining atp sites of rock catalytic domain. \\n rocki and rockii were both reported. in kidney tissues, rocki is the major one presented. \\n recent studies revealed that abnormal activation of rock signaling pathway played a very important role in the pathophysiology of all kinds of complications of diabetes [ 13, 14 ]. \\n our study confirmed that there was rock activation in renal tubular epithelium cells of 12 weeks of diabetic rats, and the effects of rock on diabetic renal interstitial space were through rock1. \\n further study found that the protein expression of e - cadherin, the marker protein of renal tubular epithelium cells, was downregulated in diabetic rats, while the protein expression of -sma, the marker protein of myofibrillar cells, was upregulated, indicating that there was emt in diabetic nephropathy of rats. \\n benidipine or fasudil can significantly inhibit nag activity, reduce urine protein and scr level, decrease the expression of p - mypt1, rock1, and -sma, and increase the expression of e - cadherin without affecting blood glucose or pressure. \\n benidipine has protective effect on diabetic nephropathy of rats, independent of its effect of lowering blood pressure. \\n tcc is a low - voltage activated channel, mainly located in renal efferent arterioles and pacing cells of the heart. through its strong blocking effects on tcc, benidipine dilates renal afferent and efferent arterioles equally and thus effectively reduces the resistance of renal vessels and intrarenal pressure. \\n it is showed that, besides its effects on adjusting capillary pressure of glomerular, tcc has many nonhemodynamic effects [ 1619 ]. \\n it regulates the activity of nf - k and thus inhibits inflammation, promotes the secretion and release of aldosterone, improves the remodeling of the heart and kidney, and anti - oxygenize and anti - proliferate [ 2023 ]. \\n it is found that in the subremoval kidney models, by inhibiting rho kinase activity, selective t channel blocker improves renal interstitial fibrosis and emt. \\n however, there are limitations of our study ; the sample size was rather small, and it is a study in animals instead of human being. in summary, \\n our study is the first study suggesting that benidipine protects kidney in rats with type 1 diabetes, possibly through its effect of inhibiting rho kinase activity and thus reducing epithelium - mesenchymal transdifferentiation ( emt ). \\n this may guide further animal studies, clinical trials on the importance of benidipine in diabetic emt development especially in type 1 diabetic, and the possible mechanism involved. from the long run \\n, it may direct the clinical use of benidipine in treating patients with diabetic nephropathy especially those in t1 dm.'},\n",

hispanic whites ; however , these differences were attenuated by adjustment for healthcare access variables . \\n there is prior data suggesting less intensive cholesterol management in women than men , resulting in a similar disparity in cholesterol control24,25 ; however data across racial / ethnic groups are somewhat limited . in national health and nutrition examination survey 20052006 , women were less likely to be hc controlled than men ( 56.9% versus 72.1% ) , and this trend was present across non - hispanic whites , non - hispanic blacks , and mexican americans ( although seemingly most disparate among non - hispanic blacks).6 prior studies of high cholesterol awareness , treatment , and control in the united states mesa indicates multi - ethnic study of atherosclerosis ; nhanes , national health and nutrition examination survey . \\n our study illustrates that among hispanic / latinos who are hc treated , the rates of hc control are fairly high ( ranging from 54% to 71% among the various hispanic / latino background groups ) . \\n studies suggest that gaps in hc treatment and control are often related to gaps in availability of , access to , or continuity of health care.2628 the affordable care act is intended to reduce some of these gaps29 by both increasing insurance coverage among the nonelderly us population and by providing coverage for cholesterol screening with no cost - sharing . \\n however , access to care alone may not resolve gaps in hc treatment and control completely . \\n other factors that may affect hc treatment and control in the us hispanic / latino population include primordial risks ( eg , diet ) , language barriers , poor patient  provider communication , and insufficient treatment ( eg , provider clinical inertia ) and/or patient medication adherence.30,31 lower out - of - pocket costs , improved patient  provider communication , and simplification of the drug regimen generally are associated with better adherence.32 the fact that there is a large gap between hc awareness and subsequent treatment and control underscores the need to go beyond screening programs and health fairs to improve the health of the hispanic / latino population . \\n those with the lowest sep ( by household income ) , while more likely to be hc aware , had a markedly lower prevalence of hc control . \\n furthermore , the lowest and highest sep groups ( by educational attainment or income ) had the highest rates of hc awareness , suggesting a disparity gap among  working poor  and  middle - class  hispanic / latinos \\n . it may be that hispanic / latinos in the lowest and highest sep categories are more likely to have health insurance , due to medicaid for those with low sep and more wealth resources for those with higher sep , respectively . \\n hispanic / latinos in the middle sep group , however , may be more likely to fall through gaps . \\n higher rates of hc awareness , treatment , and control were related to having health insurance . \\n controlling for health insurance did not remove the effect of sep on hc awareness and treatment but did remove the effect of sep on hc control . \\n compared with non - hispanic whites , hispanics are less likely to have health insurance or a regular source of care , and less likely to receive preventive services.33 increased acculturation ( by nativity and preferential english speaking ) was associated with decreased hc awareness . however , among immigrants , increasing years in the united states did increase the likelihood of hc treatment and control , perhaps due to increasing ability to navigate the us healthcare system and establishment a social support system to do so . \\n being a more recent immigrant was a more dominant acculturative factor in determining hc awareness than being able to dominate the english language . \\n similarly , increasing time in the united states portends a greater likelihood of hc control among those who were less acculturated ( preferential spanish speakers and those foreign born ) but was not a factor among the more acculturated ( preferential english speakers and those us born ) . \\n health relationship differential effect was also seen in a prior study.34 our findings of variation in hc awareness , treatment , and control across the different background groups provide further evidence of the complexity and heterogeneity of the hispanic / latino population ; thus , hc awareness , treatment , or control rates for 1 group can not be extrapolated to represent all hispanic / latinos . \\n hispanic / latinos of puerto rican and dominican background seem to fare better with regard to higher rates of hc awareness , treatment , and control whereas those of mexican , cuban , and central and south american backgrounds seem to fare worse . \\n us hispanic / latinos have differential regional patterns of settlement in the united states , with mexicans concentrated in the southwest , cubans in the southeast , central / south americans in the midwest and south , and puerto ricans and dominicans in the northeast . \\n thus , some of these differences in hc treatment and control observed among hispanic / latino background groups may be geographical in nature , given differences in medical coverage across state lines . \\n state laws governing medical coverage for low - income individuals vary and these differences are likely to worsen , with some states having declined to adopt the medicaid expansion provisions of the affordable care act . our results should be interpreted in light of several limitations . \\n while hchs / sol is the largest epidemiologic study of diverse community - dwelling us hispanic / latinos , it was not designed to be nationally representative but is representative of the communities sampled ; thus , our findings may not be generalizable to all us hispanic / latinos . \\n our findings may underestimate the prevalence of hc , since older persons residing in nursing homes or other institutions ( with potentially a higher prevalence of age - related hc ) were not included in the hchs / sol . \\n data regarding awareness was based on self - report and could be subject to recall bias . \\n the ncep / atp iii report identifies concentrations of ldl - c rather than tc as the primary target of treatment . \\n however , insights about tc are still of value and participants may not have been able to distinguish between tc and ldl - c when asked whether they had their cholesterol checked and/or had been told by a physician that their cholesterol is high . \\n our definition of treatment included coding of medications reviewed by study staff ; thus , our measure is more robust than that of several prior studies of hc treatment that used medication self - report only . \\n this study was initiated , laboratory samples were collected , and management strategies examined under the older ncep / atp iii guidelines , which focused on target levels rather than atherosclerotic risk to determine who is treated . \\n it is likely that under the new , broader american heart association / american college of cardiology cholesterol treatment guidelines,35 an even larger number of hispanic / latinos will be undertreated , further highlighting this health disparity . in conclusion \\n , we found high rates of hc and a very low prevalence of hc awareness among hispanic / latino adults and a major gap between hc awareness and hc treatment that bodes poorly for the public health of this large and growing segment of the us population . \\n not surprisingly , our observational data indicated that once treated , achievement of optimal hc control is possible among hispanic / latinos . \\n complementary and targeted public health programs to raise hc awareness and increase the proportion of hispanic / latinos receiving hc treatment and achieving hc control are needed to reduce healthcare disparities in this population . \\n our findings fill major gaps in understanding hc awareness , treatment , and control among us hispanic / latino adults , and will help guide and inform physicians and policymakers toward improving patient education programs and disease management . \\n the hispanic community health study / study of latinos was carried out as a collaborative study supported by contracts from the national heart , lung , and blood institute ( nhlbi ) to the university of north carolina ( n01-hc65233 ) , university of miami ( n01-hc65234 ) , albert einstein college of medicine ( n01-hc65235 ) , northwestern university ( n01-hc65236 ) , and san diego state university ( n01-hc65237 ) . \\n this study was partially supported by nhlbi grant r01 hl104199 ( epidemiologic determinants of cardiac structure and function among hispanic / latinos : carlos j. rodriguez , md , mph principal investigator ) . \\n dr rodriguez has received consulting agreement / honorariums from alnylam and amgen research support from the national institutes of health and the american heart association .',\n",

administered questionnaires by trained staff. \\n medication use was assessed by participants bringing all medications and supplements used during the last 4  weeks ; these were reviewed and coded by clinic staff. \\n diabetes was defined based on american diabetes association definition12 using 1 or more of the following criteria : ( 1 ) fasting serum glucose 126  mg / dl, ( 2 ) oral glucose tolerance test 200  mg / dl, ( 3 ) self - reported diabetes, ( 4 ) hb a1c 6.5%, or ( 5 ) taking antidiabetic medication or insulin. trained and certified \\n clinic staff obtained blood samples, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements on all hchs / sol participants. \\n height was measured to the nearest 0.1  cm and weight was measured to the nearest 0.1  kg with the use of a balanced scale. \\n body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. after a 5-minute rest \\n, blood pressure was measured 3 times at 1-minute intervals using an automated oscillometric device with the participant in a seated position. \\n the average of the second and third blood pressure measurements was used for this analysis. \\n hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 140  mm  hg or higher, diastolic blood pressure of 90  mm  hg or higher, or on antihypertensive treatment. \\n specimens were stored at 20c and shipped weekly to the lipoprotein analytical laboratory at the hchs / sol central lab at the university of minnesota medical center. \\n this laboratory participates in the lipid standardization program of the centers for disease control and prevention. \\n tc was measured using a cholesterol oxidase enzymatic method and high -

sharing. \\n however, access to care alone may not resolve gaps in hc treatment and control completely. \\n other factors that may affect hc treatment and control in the us hispanic / latino population include primordial risks ( eg, diet ), language barriers, poor patient  provider communication, and insufficient treatment ( eg, provider clinical inertia ) and/or patient medication adherence.30,31 lower out - of - pocket costs, improved patient  provider communication, and simplification of the drug regimen generally are associated with better adherence.32 the fact that there is a large gap between hc awareness and subsequent treatment and control underscores the need to go beyond screening programs and health fairs to improve the health of the hispanic / latino population. \\n those with the lowest sep ( by household income ), while more likely to be hc aware, had a markedly lower prevalence of hc control. \\n furthermore, the lowest and highest sep groups ( by educational attainment or income ) had the highest rates of hc awareness, suggesting a disparity gap among  working poor  and  middle - class  hispanic / latinos \\n. it may be that hispanic / latinos in the lowest and highest sep categories are more likely to have health insurance, due to medicaid for those with low sep and more wealth resources for those with higher sep, respectively. \\n higher rates of hc awareness, treatment, and control were related to having health insurance. \\n controlling for health insurance did not remove the effect of sep on hc awareness and treatment but did remove the effect of sep on hc control. \\n compared with non - hispanic whites, hispanics are less likely to have health insurance or a regular source of care, and less likely to receive preventive services.33 increased acculturation ( by nativity and preferential english speaking ) was associated with decreased hc awareness. however, among immigrants, increasing years in the united states did increase the likelihood of hc treatment and control, perhaps due to increasing ability to navigate the us healthcare system and establishment a social support system to do so. \\n being a more recent immigrant was a more dominant acculturative factor in determining hc awareness than being able to dominate the english language. \\n similarly, increasing time in the united states portends a greater likelihood of hc control among those who were less acculturated ( preferential spanish speakers and those foreign born ) but was not a factor among the more acculturated ( preferential english speakers and those us born ). \\n health relationship differential effect was also seen in a prior study.34 our findings of variation in hc awareness, treatment, and control across the different background groups provide further evidence of the complexity and heterogeneity of the hispanic / latino population ; thus, hc awareness, treatment, or control rates for 1 group can not be extrapolated to represent all hispanic / latinos. \\n hispanic / latinos of puerto rican and dominican background seem to fare better with regard to higher rates of hc awareness, treatment, and control whereas those of mexican, cuban, and central and south american backgrounds seem to fare worse. \\n us hispanic / latinos have differential regional patterns of settlement in the united states, with mexicans concentrated in the southwest, cubans in the southeast, central / south americans in the midwest and south, and puerto ricans and dominicans in the northeast. \\n thus, some of these differences in hc treatment and control observed among hispanic / latino background groups may be geographical in nature, given differences in medical coverage across state lines. \\n state laws governing medical coverage for low - income individuals vary and these differences are likely to worsen, with some states having declined to adopt the medicaid expansion provisions of the affordable care act. our results should be interpreted in light of several limitations. \\n while hchs / sol is the largest epidemiologic study of diverse community - dwelling us hispanic / latinos, it was not designed to be nationally representative but is representative of the communities sampled ; thus, our findings may not be generalizable to all us hispanic / latinos. \\n our findings may underestimate the prevalence of hc, since older persons residing in nursing homes or other institutions ( with potentially a higher prevalence of age - related hc ) were not included in the hchs / sol. \\n data regarding awareness was based on self - report and could be subject to recall bias. \\n the ncep / atp iii report identifies concentrations of ldl - c rather than tc as the primary target of treatment. \\n however, insights about tc are still of value and participants may not have been able to distinguish between tc and ldl - c when asked whether they had their cholesterol checked and/or had been told by a physician that their cholesterol is high. \\n our definition of treatment included coding of medications reviewed by study staff ; thus, our measure is more robust than that of several prior studies of hc treatment that used medication self - report only. \\n this study was initiated, laboratory samples were collected, and management strategies examined under the older ncep / atp iii guidelines, which focused on target levels rather than atherosclerotic risk to determine who is treated. \\n it is likely that under the new, broader american heart association / american college of cardiology cholesterol treatment guidelines,35 an even larger number of hispanic / latinos will be undertreated, further highlighting this health disparity. in conclusion \\n, we found high rates of hc and a very low prevalence of hc awareness among hispanic / latino adults and a major gap between hc awareness and hc treatment that bodes poorly for the public health of this large and growing segment of the us population. \\n not surprisingly, our observational data indicated that once treated, achievement of optimal hc control is possible among hispanic / latinos. \\n complementary and targeted public health programs to raise hc awareness and increase the proportion of hispanic / latinos receiving hc treatment and achieving hc control are needed to reduce healthcare disparities in this population. \\n our findings fill major gaps in understanding hc awareness, treatment, and control among us hispanic / latino adults, and will help guide and inform physicians and policymakers toward improving patient education programs and disease management. \\n the hispanic community health study / study of latinos was carried out as a collaborative study supported by contracts from the national heart, lung, and blood institute ( nhlbi ) to the university of north carolina ( n01-hc65233 ), university of miami ( n01-hc65234 ), albert einstein college of medicine ( n01-hc65235 ), northwestern university ( n01-hc65236 ), and san diego state university ( n01-hc65237 ). \\n this study was partially supported by nhlbi grant r01 hl104199 ( epidemiologic determinants of cardiac structure and function among hispanic / latinos : carlos j. rodriguez, md, mph principal investigator ). \\n dr rodriguez has received consulting agreement / honorariums from alnylam and amgen research support from the national institutes of health and the american heart association.'},\n",

reactivity between apl antibodies and anti - oxldl have also been described , factors that raise suspicion regarding an association between aps and atherosclerosis . additionally , in vitro studies indicated an increase in the uptake of oxldl complex/2gpi by macrophages upon exposure to 2gpi antibodies igg , giving a proatherogenic role of anti-2gpi in aps . \\n experimental studies have also demonstrated an association between apl and atheromatosis from immunization of groups of mice with deficiency of ldl receptor . in one experiment \\n , three groups maintained on a standard diet were immunized with 2gpi or ovalbumin or have not been immunized . \\n meanwhile , three other groups of mice were immunized in the same way , and , however , underwent an atherogenic diet . as a result , all animals \\n immunized with 2gpi develop 2gpi antibodies and subsequent acceleration of atherosclerosis compared to those immunized with ovalbumin and nonimmunized . \\n similarly , mice with deficiency of apolipoprotein e that were immunized with 2gpi develop atherosclerosis more in afek et al . . \\n in another experiment , it was evident that the anticardiolipin antibody ( acl ) increased atherogenesis in mice with deficiency of the ldl receptor , suggesting the participation of this antibody in the development of atherosclerosis in patients with aps . \\n in order to base the suspected association between the aps and premature atherosclerosis , several clinical studies have addressed patients with persistence of apl from the use of noninvasive exams aimed at early detection of atherosclerosis . the intima - media thickness ( imt ) of peripheral arteries , being important , \\n this method has been used , therefore , in assessing the extent of the atherosclerotic process , predicting cardiovascular risk in the study subjects . \\n thus , a prospective study involving 58 patients with aps and 58 controls assessed the emi , vascular stiffness , and presence of plaques in the carotid and femoral from doppler ultrasound and found as a result statistically significant differences between groups . \\n this work demonstrated , however , a predisposition to atherosclerosis in patients with primary and secondary aps , and there was no correlation between the les and the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and independence between markers atheroma with cardiovascular risk factors and inflammation . \\n additionally , a recent review selected scientific papers that investigated the carotid artery in patients with aps . as a result , three of the included studies that , overall , involved 58 patients with aps and 79 controls showed higher imt in groups with primary aps compared with the control groups [ 1618 ] . \\n two other studies have found no statistically significant difference [ 19 , 20 ] . in the study of bilora et al . \\n , atherosclerosis was evident from the use of ultrasonography : in the carotid arteries in 35.6% of patients and 35.0% of controls , in the arteries of the lower limb in 26.7% of patients and 20.0% of controls , and in the abdominal aorta in 20.0% of patients and 17.5% of controls . \\n it also detected a total number of plates 60/45 in the experimental sample and 54/40 in the control group . \\n high levels of emi and reduced luminal volume were found in patients with aps in charakida et al . \\n study , which raised the possibility of association between intima - media thickness in aps and stroke . using the evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging , other scientific publication that covered 27 aps patients and 81 controls , both that underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast , showed that approximately 30% of aps patients had silent coronary artery disease and 11.1% of them showed typical patterns of myocardial infarction . \\n this work has not identified association between coronary artery disease in aps and classical cardiovascular risk factors . \\n the evaluation of patients with primary aps from the use of positron emission tomography ( pet ) revealed the presence of endothelial dysfunction that may contribute to the acceleration of atherosclerosis in aps [ 5 , 23 ] . \\n the use of contrast echocardiography and nuclear imaging in patients with aps showed higher levels of defects in myocardial perfusion in the study of espinola - zavaleta et al . \\n , reinforcing the association with atherosclerotic manifestations in this group of patients with autoimmune disease . \\n one vascular manifestation also described in the literature as a complication of aps is the occurrence of abdominal aortic aneurysms , which raises questions about the need for screening this condition and imposes danger in cases of rupture and subsequent hemorrhage . a simple clinical method , noninvasive and easily applied in the investigation of peripheral vascular disease , is the ankle brachial index ( abi ) . in this \\n regard , barn et al . demonstrated through its clinical study abnormal abi in patients with primary aps . \\n finally , the use of transcranial ultrasound also demonstrated possible association with at subclinical fas by enhancing cerebral blood flow abnormalities in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome without neurological symptoms [ 5 , 27 ] . \\n atherosclerosis has major traditional risk factors : hypertension , diabetes mellitus , obesity , dyslipidemia , smoking , and sedentary lifestyle . \\n these comorbidities may act on inflammatory mechanisms and lipid metabolism contributing to the process of vascular injury , which therefore will trigger and propagate the formation of atherosclerotic plaques . \\n it is suspected that this process may be implicated in vascular involvement in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome . a recent cross - sectional study with 39 patients with primary aps found prevalence of traditional risk factors : 46.2% for hypertension , 12.8% for diabetes mellitus , 28.2% for hypercholesterolemia and high ldl , 15.4% of hypertriglyceridemia , 84.6% for low hdl , 28.2% of family history , 56.4% of sedentary , 15.4% with a history of smoking , and 12.8% of current smokers . in this study , we compared groups of patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome versus secondary aps ; the only risk factor that showed a significant difference between the two samples was the hdl - c , more frequent in primary aps . \\n souza et al . showed hypertension as traditional cardiovascular risk factor most strongly associated with arterial thrombotic process that occurs in the aps . \\n this study evaluated the presence of traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease ( cad ) , along with other factors in 38 patients with primary aps and 30 controls , investigating possible association with arterial thrombosis . \\n the average number of risk factors was higher in the experimental group , and , notably , hypertension was the only independently associated with arterial thrombosis \\n . regarding the lipid profile , patients exhibited higher levels of ldl and triglycerides and lower levels of hdl compared with the control group . \\n , in turn , involved 77 patients with aps and 56 asymptomatic apl and , after consideration of traditional risk factors , found no significant difference between groups . \\n however , hypertension and smoking were associated with arterial thrombotic events . the arterial involvement in this work \\n was also related to the combination of cardiovascular risk factors . in this same line of research , \\n one chinese work retrospectively analyzed 61 patients with primary aps and also showed hypertension as an independent risk factor for the development of arterial thrombosis . \\n . analyzed prospectively 404 patients with apl , divided into 2 groups : those with primary or secondary aps and those with asymptomatic apl . \\n while the presence of past surgery and immobilization were associated with the occurrence of venous thrombosis , hypertension again and this time also dyslipidemia were more prevalent in patients with arterial thrombosis . \\n in addition , half of the patients with aps had coincident cardiovascular risk factor , in contrast to the control group . \\n the study of bilora et al . , which included 45 patients with aps and 40 with secondary deep venous thrombosis despite having found a higher frequency of hypertension and diabetes mellitus in the group with aps , did not show statistically significant differences . \\n demonstrated that the cardiovascular risk factors , obesity , hypertension , and von will brand factor were more frequently found in patients with aps and , however , showed no relationship with intima - media thickness [ 1517 ] . in the medical literature also some case reports on the association between aps and diabetes mellitus are described , generally showing an angiopathy frame . \\n however , two recent reviews have evaluated the endocrine manifestations of aps and found inconsistent data with this relationship . \\n one of the reviews highlighted studies which described increases in the frequency of apl antibodies in the serum of diabetic patients implying macroangiopathic complications , besides the finding of acl igg antibodies in the serum of first - degree relatives of diabetic patients . \\n on the other hand , another literature review highlighted the need for further studies to clarify the relationship between apl and diabetes mellitus , one time found no consistent data on the prevalence and significance of apl in diabetes mellitus [ 33 , 34 ] . \\n smoking is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis by inducing vascular damage that hinders the endothelium - dependent vasodilation , probably through its various toxic compounds such as carbon monoxide and nicotine . \\n smoking cessation , therefore , tends to reduce the risk of thromboembolism , preventing the occurrence of serious cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) and stroke ; complications are very prevalent in patients with aps . \\n a recent study associated the occurrence of seizures in patients with aps ( present in 10.2% of patients with primary aps study ) with current smoking and stroke , establishing itself as an independent factor , calling attention therefore to the importance of smoking cessation in these patients , in addition to the same need to control other cardiovascular risk factors that may be present . \\n obesity is a factor which has contributed much to increased morbidity and mortality in the general population , especially for being involved with vascular complications . \\n this concern with the nutritional status of the patient is , in turn , even more valued in the course of a pregnancy due to the risk of maternal and fetal complications that obesity can cause . \\n considering such losses , this is one of the main risk factors that must be fought in individuals with aps [ 38 , 39 ] . a study by caldas et al \\n . showed worse prognosis in obese patients with primary aps compared with those who were not obese . in this transversal work , \\n 50 patients with primary aps were divided into 2 groups : aps obese ( bmi  30  kg / m ) and aps nonobese ( bmi < 30  kg / m ) . \\n the obese group had a higher frequency of pulmonary embolism ( pe ) and obstetric events . \\n klack and carvalho evaluated the efficacy of nutritional intervention in the treatment of overweight in 40 aps patients treated at least after 2 months and had positive results in the adequacy of body weight in these patients , indicating the nutritional intervention as a first choice in obese individuals with aps . \\n the influence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in the development of thromboembolic events in patients with aps is relatively well explored in the literature . \\n however , it is also necessary to highlight the role of nontraditional risk factors in this process , such as hyperhomocysteinemia and lipoprotein a . \\n high levels of this molecule have been associated with an increased frequency of vascular events such as myocardial infarction , stroke , and peripheral arterial disease . \\n a recent cross - sectional study involving 27 patients with primary aps found a percentage of 22% of hyperhomocysteinemia . \\n however , when comparing this sample with individuals who had normal levels of homocysteine , there were no significant clinical and laboratory changes . \\n another study that included 38 women with primary aps found higher levels of homocysteine in patients with arterial thrombosis than in controls , although only hypertension was independently associated with arterial thrombosis in this study . a lipoprotein is a circulating lipid particle recognized as an independent risk factor for the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and subsequent cardiovascular events ( carvalho and liming , 2009 ) . a cross - sectional study that selected 46 patients with primary aps found a frequency of 43.5% of the patients with elevated lipoprotein ; however , there was no significant association with clinical and laboratory changes . as already mentioned in this paper , oxldl molecule forms a complex with 2gpi which can be detected in the serum of patients with aps . \\n evaluated the effect of oxldl in the pathogenesis of aps which leads to acceleration of the atherosclerotic process and concluded based on their clinical study that this molecule probably contributes to the perpetuation of the immune process in aps through the production of th1-type cytokines and lymphocyte proliferation . \\n similarly , after a clinical evaluation of the association between oxldl and anti - oxldl with primary aps , becarevic et al . characterized these molecules as additional risk factors for the occurrence of thrombotic events in aps . \\n metabolic syndrome ( ms ) is a condition in which an individual is present in at least 3 of the following 5 criteria : waist circumference ( > 102  cm in men and > 88  cm for women ) , hypertriglyceridemia ( 150  mg / dl ) , low hdl ( < 40 for men and < 50 for women ) , blood pressure  130  85  mm  hg , and blood glucose  110  mg / dl . \\n the diagnosis of ms requires , therefore , a high cardiovascular risk , which should be investigated and fought mainly in patients with chronic rheumatic diseases , which are already subject to increased risk of thromboembolic events by own mechanisms of disease or by treatment with corticosteroids . \\n studies indicate higher frequency of ms in patients with rheumatic diseases than in the general population . \\n rodrigues et al . evaluated 71 patients with primary aps and 73 controls to evaluate clinical findings of ms in individuals with fasd . as a result , \\n subgroup analysis of aps with or without associated sm showed higher frequency of arterial events , angina , and lac positive in the first group . in multivariate analysis , only the sm was independently associated with arterial events in primary aps [ 47 , 48 ] . \\n the white adipose tissue is considered by some authors as a possible endocrine organ because of some of its actions as metabolic regulation of bodily functions such as thermogenesis , feeding , and lipid and glucose metabolism and cardiovascular function . \\n obesity , therefore , to generate hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipocytes , elevates levels of adipocytokines , which may lead to reduced insulin sensitivity , increased contractility , and vascular inflammation . a study by rodrigues et al . \\n evaluated 56 patients with primary aps and 72 controls finding evidence of the association between adipocytokines and low - grade inflammation , insulin resistance , and metabolic syndrome in patients with primary aps . \\n the leptin was found at high levels in this work , being associated with increased waist circumference and body mass index ( bmi ) . \\n although assigning a role and connection with atherogenic cardiovascular events , this study showed no significant difference between high levels of this hormone and the occurrence of arterial thrombosis [ 47 , 48 ] . \\n we have the following points.cardiovascular disease is a manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome.cardiovascular disease is associated with antiphospholipid antibodies , traditional risk factors ( hypertension , obesity , dyslipidemia , etc . ) , and nontraditional risk factors ( hyperhomocysteinemia , increased lipoprotein a , etc.).metabolic syndrome with all its components has been recently studied in antiphospholipid syndrome and is associated with arterial events . \\n cardiovascular disease is associated with antiphospholipid antibodies , traditional risk factors ( hypertension , obesity , dyslipidemia , etc . ) , and nontraditional risk factors ( hyperhomocysteinemia , increased lipoprotein a , etc . ) . \\n metabolic syndrome with all its components has been recently studied in antiphospholipid syndrome and is associated with arterial events .',\n",

       "  'input': '. it can be present for a few years with no symptoms , and most people do not know that they have the disease until they experience complications or advanced symptoms . \\n in addition , most people with dm do not notice the onset of symptoms such as frequent urination or extreme thirst because these symptoms increase gradually over a period of years , making it difficult for patients to notice the changes . according to the world health organization ( who ) \\n , more than 347 million people worldwide have diabetes , and prevalence will increase to double or even triple that number by the year 2030 . \\n one of the effects of dm , peripheral neuropathy , affects the feet sensation which can increase the chance of falling . \\n the central nervous system integrates the afferent information from the vestibular , visual and somatosensory systems to control balance [ 35 ] . \\n the autonomic nervous system maintains blood flow for proper muscle and organ function . during activities that require balance , blood flow increases to help the somatic and central nervous systems to control balance by providing sufficient blood flow to somatosensory organs [ 79 ] \\n this , in turn , can reduce the effectiveness of all three balance system components and , as a consequence , lead to impaired somatosensory sensation , proprioception ( vestibular system ) and vision [ 35 ] . \\n after a few years , a patient s muscles become weaker , reducing their ability to maintain their center of gravity in a stable position over their base of support without falling . as somatosensory \\n information from the foot and ankle is affected , it causes postural instability , leading to foot injuries , foot ulcers , and possibly lower limb extremity amputation . \\n it has been estimated that more than 60% of non - traumatic lower - limb amputations are related to dm . \\n falling is an expected result of postural instability and considered a major problem in older people and people with dm . \\n studies have shown that balance training such as tai chi ( tc ) exercise can improve postural stability [ 1221 ] . \\n tai chi , as a traditional exercise regimen , has been practiced in china to improve balance and postural control . \\n it is called a body - mind technique because the person uses his or her mind while accomplishing the exercise . \\n tc is a combination exercise involving weight shifting , postural alignment , and slow coordinated movements with synchronized deep breathing . \\n this combination involves many different mental and physical elements , such as calm concentration on the movement , following the instructor s example to achieve the proper form to improve muscle elasticity , while tying the movement to deep breathing in order to enhance cardiac output and support the muscles with adequate blood flow . \\n tai chi differs from other forms of exercise such as running , because the complex series of movements requires the individual to concentrate while performing each movement . \\n concentration during repetitive tasks aids in the learning process , especially in the damaged nervous system . \\n in many patients with diabetes , the feet provide false ( signal ) information to the brain about ground reaction forces due to impaired sensory function . in tc \\n , subjects move slowly , visualizing the movement while concentrating on how each movement feels ; this helps people to become more aware of sensation . \\n previous studies have supported the role of mi in terms of re - learning or re - conditioning . \\n many studies have shown that tc has positive results in elderly people in terms of minimizing the chance of falls and improving balance [ 1216,3135 ] , proprioception , circulation   and blood pressure . in a majority of the studies , \\n program interventions were lengthy , varying between 4 months to 5 years [ 1214,16,1921,25,34,36,38,39 ] . \\n shorter periods of tai chi have been shown to have benefits in stroke patients , parkinson s disease and cardiovascular disease [ 4043 ] . \\n no reports have examined the effect of tai chi for short periods ( less than 4 months ) in people with diabetes . \\n diabetes is of interest in that it is characterized by enhanced loss in sensation , balance and motor control leading to more reliance on the visual system . therefore , tai chi may be more effective if it includes more visual cues to help this population . \\n motor or mental imagery ( mi ) is defined as  the mental representation of movement without any movement  . \\n the subject relies on memory to understand the process of the action . during mental practice \\n , the subject repeats the imagined acts to improve the actual performance of the movement . \\n the combination of physical and mental practice helps to restore successful movement . in this process \\n , the person mentally and explicitly rehearses the sequence of movements required while doing the task . \\n the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 8 weeks of tc training , combined with mental imagery , on improving balance in people with diabetes and an age matched control group . \\n this is unique in that no one has combined tc with mi , a logical conclusion for people with somatosensory and vestibular impairments . in this study , it was hypothesized that focusing on mi strategies during exercise with tc would help in optimizing and improving balance and sensation in a shorter treatment time in people with diabetes compared to age matched controls . \\n the following inclusion / exclusion criteria were used to determine eligibility for enrollment in the study . \\n inclusion criteria included : 1 ) had not practiced tc in the last 4 months ; 2 ) did not exercise more than once per week ; 3 ) body mass index ( bmi ) between 10 and 35 kg / m ; 4 ) normal or controlled blood pressure ; and 5 ) normal range of motion , at least 5/5 muscle power bilateral . \\n subjects were excluded if they : 1 ) took medications which could affect balance ; 2 ) had a history of frequent falling ; 3 ) had vision problems ; and 4 ) had orthopedic/ neuromuscular/ cardiovascular impairments that restricted exercise . a convenience sample of 40 subjects , 20 of them diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and 20 subjects who were in the control group . \\n the following tools were used as valid and reliable clinical measures of balance that have been used in many studies . the balance platform used in this study \\n this device consisted of four stainless steel bars mounted at four corners of the platform ( tml strain gauge fla-6 , 350 - 17 , tokyo , japan ) . \\n the output of the strain gauge bridge was amplified by four biopac 100c low - level bio - potential amplifiers and recorded on a biopac mp 150 system through a 24-bit a / d converter . \\n , a gait belt was placed around the subject s waist as a safety precaution and a researcher remained nearby to prevent falls . \\n , the subject was asked to keep their eyes fixed on a target on the wall , with arms crossed on the chest and standing quietly on the platform with feet apart for 10 seconds . \\n the subjects were asked to perform the eight tasks in random order for 10 seconds each with one minute rest time between each task . \\n the eight tasks were : 1 ) feet apart , eyes opened and firm surface ( this task used as referent for each subject ) ; 2 ) feet apart , eyes closed and firm surface ( faec - firm ) ; 3 ) tandem standing , eyes opened and firm surface ( teo - firm ) ; 4 ) tandem standing , eyes closed and firm surface ( tec - firm ) ; 5 ) feet apart , eyes opened and foam surface ( faeo - foam ) ; 6 ) feet apart , eyes closed and foam surface ( faec - foam ) ; 7 ) tandem standing , eyes opened and foam surface tec - foam ) ; and 8) tandem standing , eyes closed and foam surface ( tec - foam ) . \\n the basic task was to stand with feet apart on a firm surface with eyes open . for each subject , this task was used as referent for all tasks . \\n this test was used to alter and challenge different sensory systems . in this study , \\n three factors were used , both singly and in combination , to investigate the effect on balance . these factors were base of support , surface challenge , and vision . \\n the mean coefficient variation was calculated to compare pre- and post - test results using the basic task as a referent for each subject . \\n subjects completed the 16-item activities - specific balance confidence ( abc ) scale   that subjectively quantifies patient confidence when performing mobility tasks . among the elderly \\n , researchers demonstrated that the abc scale has excellent test - retest reliability)r=0.92 , p<0.001 ) . \\n furthermore , a previous study had shown that the abc scale has adequate criteria and construct validity . \\n the abc score was calculated as following : the frt was used to assess dynamic balance . \\n a yardstick was placed on the wall at shoulder level and the subjects were asked to stand with their dominant shoulder next to the wall without touching or leaning on the wall and then elevate their arm to 90 degrees of shoulder flexion parallel to the wall . \\n the investigator recorded the starting position at the distal end of the third metacarpal head on the yardstick . \\n the subject then was asked to reach forward as much as possible without taking a step forward , and the maximum reaching point was recorded . \\n the investigator demonstrated the task and asked the subject repeat to it as to ensure that the subject performed the test correctly . \\n the frt has excellent test retest reliability ( icc=0.92 ) and inter rater reliability ( icc=0.98 ) . \\n the subject was asked to stand on one leg with eyes open and arms on the hips . \\n the length of time was recorded from when the patient s foot was off the floor until it touched the floor again . \\n researchers have found that the ols has a good interclass correlation coefficient ( icc range=0.95 to 0.099 ) and within the rater interclass correlation coefficient ( icc=0.73 to 0.93 ) . the hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) , a blood test which measures the average concentration of blood glucose over a 3-month period , is the most common outcome measure for glucose control . \\n approximately 5 l of blood ( from finger stick ) was obtained and used to measure the hba1c level with a food and drug administration ( fda ) approved device called the dcv vantage analyzer ( siemens , tarrytown , ny , usa ) . all subjects in both groups underwent the same tc exercise program . \\n tc has many styles , and we found that the yang style was the most appropriate because it had the important characteristics relevant to mi and somatosensory enhancement . \\n these characteristics included slow coordinated movement , weight shifting with wide steps , a one - leg stance , stretching , and mental concentration . \\n the exercise was conducted over a thick mat and with shoes off for greater sensory enhancement and challenge as indicated in previous studies . in this study , we used mi strategies , for example , subjects were asked to concentrate on sequence of each movement in tc . \\n also , they were asked to mentor the exercise visually from the tc instructor before they executed any movement . \\n then , they were instructed to do and feel the movement sequence while they visually were watching themselves in the front of the mirror with supervision from the instructor to correct any movement if needed to achieve better outcomes as reported in a previous study . after screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria , \\n subjects were provided with detailed information regarding the purpose of the study , procedures and tests , potential risks and scheduled time of the tc exercise . if the subject agreed to proceed , he / she signed the informed consent form as approved by institutional review board ( irb ) at loma linda university before proceeding to testing and taking measurements . \\n baseline measurements were taken to assess balance using the following tools : 1 ) balance platform test ; 2 ) the activities - specific balance confidence ( abc ) scale , 3 ) one leg standing test ( ols ) , and 4 ) function reach test ( frt ) . \\n each session consisted of 15 minutes of warming - up exercises , including stretching , loosening the muscles , and breathing exercises , and followed by 45 minutes of tc exercise , yang style . \\n the first test was conducted during the informed consent process , and then outcome measures taken after the subjects completed the 8-week tc exercise intervention . \\n the demographic characteristics of the subjects were compared between the diabetic and control groups using independent t - test for the quantitative variables and chi - square for independence for categorical variables . \\n the normality of the outcome variables at baseline and post intervention was examined using one - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test . \\n since the distribution of these variables was not approximately normal , the baseline scores and differences between post and pre measures for abc , frt and ols were compared between the two groups using mann - whitney u test . in each study group \\n , comparisons between post and pre measures after the tc exercise were assessed using the wilcoxon signed rank test . \\n for the different balance tasks , changes between post and pre measures were examined using paired t - test and between diabetic and control groups using an independent t - test . \\n the following inclusion / exclusion criteria were used to determine eligibility for enrollment in the study . \\n inclusion criteria included : 1 ) had not practiced tc in the last 4 months ;

       "  'input': 'in the last decades health professionals have been often organized into many specialties \\n and subspecialties directed to several body organs and systems . \\n the human organism is a \\n unity that is composed by an infinite number of biologic processes so strongly linked \\n that abnormalities in any part of the body and/or its processes may have deep effects in \\n many other body areas , exemplified in this review by two highly prevalent diseases : pd \\n and dm . \\n an imbalance \\n between a localized infection and an exaggerated host inflammatory response plays a \\n pivotal role in determining gingival tissue damage . \\n recent evidence suggests that the \\n effect of pd might not be limited just to the oral cavity but it might have systemic \\n consequences . \\n although , the mechanisms behind this association remain unclear , pd might \\n represent one distant source of low - grade systemic inflammation . \\n this association could \\n explain the increased risk of impaired metabolic control in diabetes - related \\n complications and the adverse effects of dm on periodontal health . \\n there is strong evidence that the \\n prevalence , severity and progression of pd are significantly higher in people with \\n dm . in this review \\n we describe the common processes involved in pd and dm and briefly review \\n the evidence produced to support an association between pd , dm and diabetes - related \\n complications . \\n pd is a chronic bacterial infection that affects both the gingiva and the bone that \\n supports the teeth and is caused by anaerobic gram - negative microorganisms that are \\n present in the bacterial plaque that adheres to the teeth . \\n pd is a very prevalent condition . in the united states , over half the population aged \\n 18 years or more have pd in its early stages , increasing to up to 75% after the age \\n of 35 years ; its mild to moderate forms are present in 30% to 50% , and \\n pd has even higher prevalence in \\n minorities , in poor and developing countries and a considerable global \\n variation . \\n the presence of anaerobic gram - negative bacteria causes a local inflammatory response \\n that becomes chronic and progressive ; this inflammation of the gingiva causes \\n alveolar bone destruction and loss of the tissue attachment to the teeth , caused by \\n components of microbial plaque that have the capacity to induce an initial infiltrate \\n of inflammatory cells , such as lymphocytes , macrophages , and polymorphonuclear \\n leukocytes ( pmns ) . \\n some microbial components , especially lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) , activate macrophages \\n that synthesize and secrete a great variety and amount of pro - inflammatory molecules , \\n such as the cytokines interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- ) ; \\n prostaglandins , especially prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) ; and some other enzymes . \\n bacterial toxins can also activate t lymphocytes to produce il-1 and lymphotoxin \\n ( lt ) , a molecule with properties that are similar to those of tnf-. these cytokines \\n show potent pro - inflammatory and catabolic activities , and have important roles in \\n periodontal tissue destruction caused by collagenolytic enzymes such as \\n metalloproteinases ( mmps ) . \\n these \\n collagenolytic enzymes are activated by reactive oxygen species and elevate the \\n levels of interstitial collagenase in inflamed gingival tissue . \\n the attachment loss deepens the sulcus , creating a periodontal pocket that contains \\n thousands of millions of bacterial cells . \\n this stage is the transition between \\n gingivitis and periodontitis , the most common pds . \\n when bacterial biofilms on the teeth are not disrupted on a regular basis , the \\n emergences of gram - negative anaerobic bacterial species activate several host \\n processes that will interfere in the extent and severity of the disease . \\n recently , many advances have occurred in the knowledge of the nature of the \\n infectious agents involved in pd . \\n approximately 500 different bacterial entities and \\n various human viruses have already been associated with the formation of dental \\n microbial plaque . \\n the most frequently recognized periodontal pathogens belong to three microaerophilic \\n species ( actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , campylobacter rectus , \\n and eikenella corrodens ) and seven anaerobic species \\n ( porphyromonas gingivalis , bacteroides forsythus , treponema denticola , \\n prevotella intermedia , fusobacterium nucleatum , eubacterium , and \\n spirochetes ) . \\n various herpes viruses , such as the human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) and epstein - barr \\n virus ( ebv-1 ) , have recently also emerged as pathogens in cases of destructive \\n pd . \\n many conditions can predispose and/or facilitate the occurrence of pd such as \\n smoking , genetic influences , estrogen \\n deficiency , estrogen \\n excess , \\n dyslipidemia and obesity . \\n this epidemic is also associated with an increased occurrence \\n of obesity - related diseases like hypertension , cardiovascular disease , metabolic \\n syndrome and dm that are also linked to pd . \\n dm encompasses a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous metabolic \\n disorders characterized by hyperglycemia that results from a defective insulin \\n secretion and/or activity . \\n dm is classified according to its etiology as type 1 ( t1d ) , type 2 ( t2d ) , gestational \\n diabetes ( gdm ) and other specific types . \\n t1d results from the destruction of \\n beta - cells within the islets of langerhans of the pancreas , which results in a \\n complete insulin deficiency ; it can be immune - mediated or have an idiopathic \\n etiology . \\n t2d ranges from an insulin resistance which progresses into an insulin \\n deficiency due to a secondary failure in the pancreatic beta - cells . \\n gdm is defined as \\n any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy . \\n lastly , the category \" other specific types \" comprehends a group of several types of \\n dm with different etiologies . \\n developed countries have a higher prevalence of dm than developing countries and more \\n women than men are affected with dm . \\n the \\n prevalence of dm in adults all over the world was estimated to be around 4.0% and it \\n was expected to rise to 5.4% by the year 2025 . numerically it means a rise from 135 \\n million in 1995 to 300 million in the year 2025 . \\n an increase of 42% ( from 51 to 72 million ) is expected \\n in developed countries and an increase of 170% ( from 84 to 228 million ) in the \\n developing world . \\n therefore , it is expected that by the year 2025 , 75% of people with \\n dm will be living in developing countries where the majority of people with dm are \\n aged between 45 - 64 years old . \\n in developed countries , the majority of people with dm \\n are older than 65 years . \\n people with diabetes and with chronically poor metabolic control can experience \\n micro - vascular and macro - vascular complications leading to a significant burden for \\n the individual and for the society . \\n this burden includes direct costs of medical care \\n and indirect costs , such as loss of productivity , which result from diabetes - related \\n morbidity and premature mortality . health care expenses for people with diabetes is more than two - times higher than the \\n expenses for people without diabetes ; the direct and indirect expenditures \\n attributable to diabetes in 2007 in the usa were estimated at us$174 billion , with \\n slightly more spent on chronic complications attributable to dm than properly on dm \\n care . \\n the international \\n diabetes federation estimated that dm costs account for 5 - 10% of the total healthcare \\n budget in many countries . in brazil , \\n the per capita total , direct medical , direct nonmedical \\n and indirect costs of patients with t1d were us$ 1,741.42 , us$ 1,319.15 , us$ 61.47 \\n and us$ 360.81 , respectively . \\n the total direct non - medical costs were us$ 195,461.54 , \\n spent with transportation for the patients and caregivers . \\n total annual costs for care of outpatients with t2d \\n were us$ 2,108 per patient , out of which us$ 1,335 per \\n patient of direct costs ( 63.3% ) and us$ 773 per patient of \\n indirect costs ( 36.7% ) . \\n patients with both micro - vascular and macro - vascular \\n complications had higher costs ( us$ 3,199 per patient ) compared to \\n those with either micro - vascular ( us$ 2,062 per patient ) or \\n macro - vascular ( us$ 2,517 per patient ) complications only . \\n the \\n greatest amount of direct costs was attributed to medication ( 48.2% ) . the search conducted for \\n this review used the bbo ( bibliografia brasileira de \\n odontologia ) , medline , lilacs and pubmed for controlled trials databases , in english \\n and portuguese languages published from 1960 to october 2012 . \\n primary research \\n reports on investigations of relationships between dm / dm control , pd / periodontal \\n treatment and pd / dm / diabetes - related complications identified relevant papers and \\n meta - analyses published in this period . \\n the identified reports are displayed in figures organized \\n according to the following groups : 1- the effects of dm on pd ;

one study reported more extensive radiographic bone \\n loss in patients with t1d compared to the controls , lalla , et al . \\n ( 2006 ) in a case - control study found that periodontal \\n destruction can start very early in life in patients with t1d and becomes more \\n prominent as children become adolescents . in a population aged 4 to 33 years , \\n ( 1982 ) reported a \\n significantly higher prevalence of pd in t1d than in non - diabetic siblings and \\n non - diabetic unrelated controls . \\n the prevalence of pd among 11- to 18-year - old \\n teenagers with dm was 9.8% as compared to 1.7% in controls without dm . \\n an accelerated \\n periodontal destruction was found in children and teens with dm , with poor metabolic \\n control . in an adult \\n population aged 40 - 69 years \\n , 58.4% of patients with long standing t1d exhibited \\n severe pd as opposed to 7.1% of controls without dm . \\n two \\n reports were comprised of patients aged 15 years or older , and \\n twelve included only adults . \\n twelve of these fourteen \\n studies reported significantly poorer periodontal health in subjects with t2d , \\n whereas a significantly poorer greater prevalence was found in one study and no significant difference was \\n found in another study . \\n six reports consist of analyses in which subjects with t1d and t2d were analyzed \\n together without distinction of diabetes type . four studies included children and \\n adolescents and another \\n five of these six studies reported greater \\n prevalence , extent , or severity of pd in subjects with dm . \\n one report did not \\n find significant differences in pd between subjects with and without dm when an \\n adequate metabolic control was found in the former group . regarding gdm , \\n one was conducted only with women with gdm \\n that were compared to a control group between the 34 - 36 gestation weeks . \\n the results of the study suggest that gingivitis seems to be more prevalent in women \\n with gdm compared to healthy pregnant women and the plaque accumulation seems to be \\n the main cause of gingival inflammation . \\n another study found that all types of dm increase the risk of \\n pd , including gdm . \\n two other \\n studies conducted in the usa collected data from over 4,000 women with a history of \\n gdm . \\n one report included ages 15 - 44 and the other , ages 20 - 59 . both reports concluded there is a strong relationship \\n between gdm and pd . \\n pd was found in 45% of pregnant women with gdm \\n vs. 13% in the healthy pregnant women , with an adjusted odds \\n ratio of 9.11 . in non - pregnant women , 40% of women with t1d or t2d , 25% of those with \\n a history of gdm , and 14% of healthy women had pd . the odds ratio for those with t1d \\n and t2d was 2.76 . \\n ( 2006 ) found the \\n prevalence of pd to be higher in women with a history of gdm and concluded that these \\n women may be at greater risk for developing more severe pd , than women without a \\n history of gdm . \\n finally , taylor \\n ( 2001 ) and mealey ( 2006 ) in two \\n extensive literature reviews found a bidirectional interrelationship between all \\n types of dm , including gdm and pd . \\n two of these studies included subjects with t1d exclusively , seven studies subjects \\n with t2d exclusively and five a combination of subjects with either t1d , t2d , gdm and \\n others ( figure 2 ) . \\n one prospective study \\n conducted with t1d did not show any association between the degree of glycemic \\n control and pd but a positive association with local oral hygiene measures , and another study , that was \\n cross - sectional , has regarded this association . \\n five of the seven reports published regarding the \\n association between glycemic control and pd in t2d have found this \\n association and two did not . \\n we have found five studies providing \\n information on the differences in periodontal health in groups of mixed types of \\n diabetes ; three have found this association and two did not . among these fourteen studies , \\n eleven were cross - sectional that \\n imposes some limitations on the cause - effect inference ; two were prospective and one \\n was an extensive literature review . \\n otherwise , nine of these reports support the \\n evidence of greater prevalence , extent and severity of pd and also provide evidence \\n that glycemic control worsens in parallel with the worsening of pd . \\n effects of glycemic control on periodontal disease ( gdm= gestational diabetes \\n mellitus ) substantial evidence has been demonstrating dm as a risk factor for the impairment of \\n periodontal health and a growing body of evidence has been supporting pd as having an \\n adverse effect on glycemic control and on the pathophysiology of diabetes - related \\n complications . \\n the inflamed periodontal tissue may serve as a chronic source of \\n bacteria , bacterial products and many inflammatory mediators such as tnf- , il6 , and \\n il1 that have been shown to have important effects on lipid and glucose \\n metabolism and have also been reported to be \\n insulin antagonists and related to insulin resistance that is predominantly found in \\n t2d and gdm . \\n as shown in figure 3 , data interpretation is \\n often confounded by varying definitions of dm and pd and different clinical criteria \\n applied to determine the prevalence , extent , severity of pd , levels of glycemic \\n control and diabetes - related complications ; there is also marked heterogeneity in the \\n studies \\' designs , conduct , length of follow - up , types of participants , and \\n periodontal treatment protocols . \\n effects of periodontal disease on glycemic control and diabetes - related \\n complications abbreviations : rct , randomized controlled trial ;

every percentage point decrease in hba1c , was \\n associated with a 25% reduction in diabetes - related deaths , 7% reduction in all - cause \\n mortality , and a 18% reduction in combined fatal and nonfatal myocardial \\n infarction . \\n some observational studies regarding the association between pd and the risk for dm \\n complications have given strong evidence for this association . in a study conducted \\n in sweden , with 39 case - control pairs of individuals with t1d and t2d for a median \\n follow - up time of six years , thorstensson , et al . \\n ( 1996 ) observed a significantly higher prevalence \\n of proteinuria and cardiovascular complications such as stroke , transient ischemic \\n attacks , angina , myocardial infarction and intermittent claudication in the case \\n group than in controls . \\n these findings suggest that an association between renal \\n disease , cardiovascular disease and its complications and severe periodontitis seems \\n to exist . \\n ( 2005 ) , studied \\n the contribution of pd to the mortality associated with t2d in the gila river indian \\n community in arizona , usa , on behalf of the national institute of diabetes and \\n digestive and kidney diseases , addressing nephropathy and cardiovascular disease . \\n this was a prospective longitudinal study with a cohort of 628 individuals , aged \\n approximately 35 years old , for a median follow - up of eleven years ( range 0.3 to 16 ) . \\n during the study period 204 subjects died . \\n individuals with severe pd had 3.2 times \\n greater risk for cardio - renal mortality ( i.e. , ischemic heart disease and diabetic \\n nephropathy combined ) compared with the reference group ( no , mild , or moderate pd \\n combined ) , after adjustment for several major risk factors of cardio - renal mortality \\n such as age , sex , diabetes duration , hba1c , body mass index ( bmi ) , hypertension , \\n blood glucose , cholesterol , electrocardiographic abnormalities , macro - albuminuria , \\n and smoking . \\n ( 2007 ) , in the same community investigated the effect of \\n periodontitis on overt nephropathy and end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) in a group of \\n 529 subjects with t2d , aged approximately 25 years old . after adjusting for age , sex , \\n diabetes duration , bmi , and smoking \\n , they found that periodontitis and edentulism \\n were significantly associated with the risk of overt nephropathy and esrd . \\n the \\n incidence of macro - albuminuria was 2.0 , 2.1 , and 2.6 times greater in individuals \\n with moderate or severe periodontitis or in those who were edentulous , respectively , \\n than those with none / mild periodontitis . \\n the incidence of esrd was also 2.3 , 3.5 , and \\n 4.9 times greater for individuals with moderate or severe periodontitis or for those \\n who were edentulous , respectively , than those with none / mild periodontitis . \\n the clinical and epidemiological evidence found in the literature we reviewed \\n provides support for the concept that dm can have adverse effects on pd , that pd \\n worsens in parallel with glycemic control and finally that pd is associated with an \\n increase in the risk for diabetes - related complications . \\n however , further \\n prospective , rigorous , controlled trials with a larger number of patients , in \\n ethnically diverse populations are warranted to establish these relationships and \\n that treating pd can positively influence glycemic control and possibly reduce the \\n burden of diabetes - related complications . \\n pd is a chronic bacterial infection that affects both the gingiva and the bone that \\n supports the teeth and is caused by anaerobic gram - negative microorganisms that are \\n present in the bacterial plaque that adheres to the teeth . \\n pd is a very prevalent condition . in the united states , over half the population aged \\n 18 years or more \\n have pd in its early stages , increasing to up to 75% after the age \\n of 35 years ; its mild to moderate forms are present in 30% to 50% , and the severe \\n generalized form in 5% to 15% of the general adult population . \\n pd has even higher prevalence in \\n minorities , in poor and developing countries and a considerable global \\n variation . \\n the presence of anaerobic gram - negative bacteria causes a local inflammatory response \\n that becomes chronic and progressive ; this inflammation of the gingiva causes \\n alveolar bone destruction and loss of the tissue attachment to the teeth , caused by \\n components of microbial plaque that have the capacity to induce an initial infiltrate \\n of inflammatory cells , such as lymphocytes , macrophages , and polymorphonuclear \\n leukocytes ( pmns ) . \\n some microbial components , especially lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) , activate macrophages \\n that synthesize and secrete a great variety and amount of pro - inflammatory molecules , \\n such as the cytokines interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- ) ; \\n prostaglandins , especially prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) ; and some other enzymes . \\n bacterial toxins can also activate t lymphocytes to produce il-1 and lymphotoxin \\n ( lt ) , a molecule with properties that are similar to those of tnf-. these cytokines \\n show potent pro - inflammatory and catabolic activities , and have important roles in \\n periodontal tissue destruction caused by collagenolytic enzymes such as \\n metalloproteinases ( mmps ) . \\n these \\n collagenolytic enzymes are activated by reactive oxygen species and elevate the \\n levels of interstitial collagenase in inflamed gingival tissue . \\n the attachment loss deepens the sulcus , creating a periodontal pocket that contains \\n thousands of millions of bacterial cells . \\n this stage is the transition between \\n gingivitis and periodontitis , the most common pds . \\n when bacterial biofilms on the teeth are not disrupted on a regular basis , the \\n emergences of gram - negative anaerobic bacterial species activate several host \\n processes that will interfere in the extent and severity of the disease . \\n recently , many advances have occurred in the knowledge of the nature of the \\n infectious agents involved in pd . \\n approximately 500 different bacterial entities and \\n various human viruses have already been associated with the formation of dental \\n microbial plaque . \\n the most frequently recognized periodontal pathogens belong to three microaerophilic \\n species ( actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , campylobacter rectus , \\n and eikenella corrodens ) and seven anaerobic species \\n ( porphyromonas gingivalis , bacteroides forsythus , treponema denticola , \\n prevotella intermedia , fusobacterium nucleatum , eubacterium , and \\n spirochetes ) . \\n various herpes viruses , such as the human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) and epstein - barr \\n virus ( ebv-1 ) , have recently also emerged as pathogens in cases of destructive \\n pd . \\n many conditions can predispose and/or facilitate the occurrence of pd such as \\n smoking , genetic influences , estrogen \\n deficiency , estrogen \\n excess , \\n dyslipidemia and obesity . \\n this epidemic is also associated with an increased occurrence \\n of obesity - related diseases like hypertension , cardiovascular disease , metabolic \\n syndrome and dm that are also linked to pd . \\n dm encompasses a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous metabolic \\n disorders characterized by hyperglycemia that results from a defective insulin \\n secretion and/or activity . \\n dm is classified according to its etiology as type 1 ( t1d ) , type 2 ( t2d ) , gestational \\n diabetes ( gdm ) and other specific types . \\n t1d results from the destruction of \\n beta - cells within the islets of langerhans of the pancreas , which results in a \\n complete insulin deficiency ; it can be immune - mediated or have an idiopathic \\n etiology . \\n t2d ranges from an insulin resistance which progresses into an insulin \\n deficiency due to a secondary failure in the pancreatic beta - cells . \\n gdm is defined as \\n any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy . \\n lastly , the category \" other specific types \" comprehends a group of several types of \\n dm with different etiologies . \\n developed countries have a higher prevalence of dm than developing countries and more \\n women than men are affected with dm . \\n the \\n prevalence of dm in adults all over the world was estimated to be around 4.0% and it \\n was expected to rise to 5.4% by the year 2025 . numerically it means a rise from 135 \\n million in 1995 to 300 million in the year 2025 . \\n an increase of 42% ( from 51 to 72 million ) is expected \\n in developed countries and an increase of 170% ( from 84 to 228 million ) in the \\n developing world . \\n therefore , it is expected that by the year 2025 , 75% of people with \\n dm will be living in developing countries where the majority of people with dm are \\n aged between 45 - 64 years old . in developed countries , \\n people with diabetes and with chronically poor metabolic control can experience \\n micro - vascular and macro - vascular complications leading to a significant burden for \\n the individual and for the society . \\n this burden includes direct costs of medical care \\n and indirect costs , such as loss of productivity , which result from diabetes - related \\n morbidity and premature mortality . \\n health care expenses for people with diabetes is more than two - times higher than the \\n expenses for people without diabetes ; the direct and indirect expenditures \\n attributable to diabetes in 2007 in the usa were estimated at us$174 billion , with \\n slightly more spent on chronic complications attributable to dm than properly on dm \\n care . \\n the international \\n diabetes federation estimated that dm costs account for 5 - 10% of the total healthcare \\n budget in many countries . in brazil , \\n the per capita total , direct medical , direct nonmedical \\n and indirect costs of patients with t1d were us$ 1,741.42 , us$ 1,319.15 , us$ 61.47 \\n and us$ 360.81 , respectively . \\n the total direct non - medical costs were us$ 195,461.54 , \\n spent with transportation for the patients and caregivers . \\n total annual costs for care of outpatients with t2d \\n were us$ 2,108 per patient , out of which us$ 1,335 per \\n patient of direct costs ( 63.3% ) and us$ 773 per patient of \\n indirect costs ( 36.7% ) . \\n patients with both micro - vascular and macro - vascular \\n complications had higher costs ( us$ 3,199 per patient ) compared to \\n those with either micro - vascular ( us$ 2,062 per patient ) or \\n macro - vascular ( us$ 2,517 per patient ) complications only . \\n the search conducted for this review used the bbo ( bibliografia brasileira de \\n odontologia ) , medline , lilacs and pubmed for controlled trials databases , in english \\n and portuguese languages published from 1960 to october 2012 . \\n primary research \\n reports on investigations of relationships between dm / dm control , pd / periodontal \\n treatment and pd / dm / diabetes - related complications identified relevant papers and \\n meta - analyses published in this period . \\n the identified reports are displayed in figures organized \\n according to the following groups : 1- the effects of dm on pd ;

       "  'model_output': 'periodontal disease ( pd ) is a chronic inflammatory process that affects both the gingiva and the bone that supports the teeth. \\n the prevalence of pd is high, especially in developing countries. the presence of anaerobic gram - negative bacteria causes a local inflammatory response that becomes chronic and progressive. \\n this inflammation of the gingiva causes alveolar bone destruction and loss of the tissue attachment to the teeth, caused by components of microbial plaque that have the capacity to induce an initial infiltrate of inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( pmns ). \\n some microbial components, especially lipopolysaccharide ( lps ), activate macrophages that synthesize and secrete a great variety and amount of pro - inflammatory molecules, such as the cytokines interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- ) ; prostaglandins, especially prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) ; and some other enzymes. \\n bacterial toxins can also activate t lymphocytes to produce il-1 and lymphotoxin ( lt ), a molecule with properties that are similar to those of tnf-. these cytokines show potent pro - inflammatory and catabolic activities, and have important roles in periodontal tissue destruction caused by collagenolytic enzymes such as metalloproteinases ( mmps ). \\n these collagenolytic enzymes are activated by reactive oxygen species and elevate the levels of interstitial collagenase in inflamed gingival tissue. \\n the attachment loss deepens the sulcus, creating a periodontal pocket that contains thousands of millions of bacterial cells. \\n this stage is the transition between gingivitis and periodontitis, the most common pds. \\n when bacterial biofilms on the teeth are not disrupted on a regular basis, the emergences of gram - negative anaerobic bacterial species activate several host processes that will interfere in the extent and severity of the disease. \\n recently, many advances have occurred in the knowledge of the nature of the infectious agents involved in pd. \\n approximately 500 different bacterial entities and various human viruses have already been associated with the formation of dental microbial plaque. \\n the most frequently recognized periodontal pathogens belong to three microaerophilic species ( actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens ) and seven anaerobic species ( porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium, and spirochetes ). \\n various herpes viruses, such as the human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) and epstein - barr virus ( ebv-1 ), have recently also emerged as pathogens in cases of destructive pd. \\n many conditions can predispose and/or facilitate the occurrence of pd such as smoking, genetic influences, estrogen deficiency, estrogen excess, dyslipidemia and obesity. \\n this epidemic is also associated with an increased occurrence of obesity - related diseases like hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and dm that are also linked to pd. \\n dm encompasses a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia that results from a defective insulin secretion and/or activity. \\n dm is classified according to its etiology as type 1 ( t1d ), type 2 ( t2d ), gestational diabetes ( gdm ) and other specific types. \\n t1d results from the destruction of beta - cells within the islets of langerhans of the pancreas, which results in a complete insulin deficiency ; it can be immune - mediated or have an idiopathic etiology. \\n t2d ranges from an insulin resistance which progresses into an insulin deficiency due to a secondary failure in the pancreatic beta - cells. \\n gdm is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. \\n lastly, the category \" other specific types \" comprehends a group of several types of dm with different etiologies. \\n developed countries have a higher prevalence of dm than developing countries and more women than men are affected with dm. \\n the prevalence of dm in adults all over the world was estimated to be around 4.0% and it was expected to rise to 5.4% by the year 2025. numerically it means a rise from 135 million in 1995 to 300 million in the year 2025. an increase of 42% ( from 51 to 72 million ) is expected in developed countries and an increase of 170% ( from 84 to 228 million ) in the developing world. therefore, it is expected that by the year 2025, 75% of people with dm will be living in developing countries where the majority of people with dm are aged between 45 - 64 years old. in developed countries, people with diabetes and with chronically poor metabolic control can experience micro - vascular and macro - vascular complications leading to a significant burden for the individual and for the society. this burden includes direct costs of medical care and indirect costs, such as loss of productivity, which result from diabetes - related morbidity and premature mortality. health care expenses for people with diabetes is more than two - times higher than the expenses for people without diabetes ; the direct and indirect expenditures attributable to diabetes in 2007 in the usa were estimated at us$174 billion, with slightly more spent on chronic complications attributable to dm than properly on dm care. the international diabetes federation estimated that dm costs account for 5 - 10% of the total healthcare budget in many countries. in brazil, the per capita total, direct medical, direct nonmedical and indirect costs of patients with t1d were us$ 1,741.42, us$ 1,319.15, us$ 61.47 and us$ 360.81, respectively. the total direct non - medical costs were us$ 195,461.54, spent with transportation for the patients and caregivers. total annual costs for care of outpatients with t2d were us$ 2,108 per patient, out of which us$ 1,335 per patient of direct costs ( 63.3% ) and us$ 773 per patient of indirect costs ( 36.7% ). patients with both micro - vascular and macro - vascular complications had higher costs ( us$ 3,199 per patient ) compared to those with either micro - vascular ( us$ 2,062 per patient ) or macro - vascular ( us$ 2,517 per patient ) complications only. the search conducted for this review used the bbo ( bibliografia brasileira de odontologia ), medline, lilacs and pubmed for controlled trials databases, in english and portuguese languages published from 1960 to october 2012. primary research reports on investigations of relationships between dm / dm control, pd / periodontal treatment and pd / dm / diabetes - related complications identified relevant papers and meta - analyses published in this period. the identified reports are displayed in figures organized according to the following groups : 1- the effects of dm on pd ; 2- the effects of glycemic control on pd and 3-the effects of pd on glycemic control and on diabetes - related complications. the studies listed in figure 1 compared periodontal status in individuals with and without dm in the majority of the reports. these studies were classified according to the study design, type of diabetes, sample number, age range, evaluation of pd and other diabetes - related variables. the majority of the studies were cross - sectional ( 21/29 ) and limited in the possibility of providing a causal - effect relationship. effects of diabetes mellitus on periodontal disease pd= periodontal disease - dm = diabetes mellitus - t1d = diabetes mellitus type 1 - t2d = diabetes mellitus type 2 - gdm = gestational diabetes mellitus the link between dm and the adverse effects on pd has been extensively described. we have found that 27 in 29 studies showed supportive evidence of the adverse impact of dm on periodontal health. there were four studies of t1d ; one study reported more extensive radiographic bone loss in patients with t1d compared to the controls, lalla, et al. ( 2006 ) in a case - control study found that periodontal destruction can start very early in life in patients with t1d and becomes more prominent as children become adolescents. in a population aged 4 to 33 years, cianciola, et al. ( 1982 ) reported a significantly higher prevalence of pd in t1d than in non - diabetic siblings and non - diabetic unrelated controls. the prevalence of pd among 11- to 18-year - old teenagers with dm was 9.8% as compared to 1.7% in controls without dm. an accelerated periodontal destruction was found in children and teens with dm, with poor metabolic control. in an adult population aged 40 - 69 years, 58.4% of patients with long standing t1d exhibited severe pd as opposed to 7.1% of controls without dm. two reports were comprised of patients aged 15 years or older, and twelve included only adults. twelve of these fourteen studies reported significantly poorer periodontal health in subjects with t2d, whereas a significantly poorer greater prevalence was found in one study and no significant difference was found in another study. six reports consist of analyses in which subjects with t1d and t2d were analyzed together without distinction of diabetes type. four studies included children and adolescents and another five of these six studies reported greater prevalence, extent, or severity of pd in subjects with dm. one report did not find significant differences in pd between subjects with and without dm when an adequate metabolic control was found in the former group. regarding gdm, one was conducted only with women with gdm that were compared to a control group between the 34 - 36 gestation weeks. the results of the study suggest that gingivitis seems to be more prevalent in women with gdm compared to healthy pregnant women and the plaque accumulation seems to be the main cause of gingival inflammation. another study found that all types of dm increase the risk of pd, including gdm. two other studies conducted in the usa collected data from over 4,000 women with a history of gdm. one report included ages 15 - 44 and the other, ages 20 - 59. pd was found in 45% of pregnant women with gdm vs. 13% in the healthy pregnant women, with an adjusted odds ratio of 9.11. in non - pregnant women, 40% of women with t1d or t2d, 25% of those with a history of gdm, and 14% of healthy women had pd. ( 2006 ) found the prevalence of pd to be higher in women with a history of gdm and concluded that these women may be at greater risk for developing more severe pd, than women without a history of gdm. finally, taylor ( 2001 ) and mealey ( 2006 ) in two extensive literature reviews found a bidirectional interrelationship between all types of dm, including gdm and pd. two of these studies included subjects with t1d exclusively, seven studies subjects with t2d exclusively and five a combination of subjects with either t1d, t2d, gdm and others ( figure 2 ). one prospective study conducted with t1d did not show any association between the degree of glycemic control and pd but a positive association with local oral hygiene measures, and another study, that was cross - sectional, has regarded this association. five of the seven reports published regarding the association between glycemic control and pd in t2d have found this association and two did not. we have found five studies providing information on the differences in periodontal health in groups of mixed types of diabetes ; three have found this association and two did not. among these fourteen studies, eleven were cross - sectional that imposes some limitations on the cause - effect inference ; two were prospective and one was an extensive literature review. otherwise, nine of these reports support the evidence of greater prevalence, extent and severity of pd and also provide evidence that glycemic control worsens in parallel with the worsening of pd. substantial evidence has been demonstrating dm as a risk factor for the impairment of periodontal health and a growing body of evidence has been supporting pd as having an adverse effect on glycemic control and on the pathophysiology of diabetes - related complications. the inflamed periodontal tissue may serve as a chronic source of bacteria, bacterial products and many inflammatory mediators such as tnf-, il6, and il1 that have been shown to have important effects on lipid and glucose metabolism and have also been reported to be insulin antagonists and related to insulin resistance that is predominantly found in t2d and gdm. as shown in figure 3, data interpretation is often confounded by varying definitions of dm and pd and different clinical criteria applied to determine the prevalence, extent, severity of pd, levels of glycemic control and diabetes - related complications ; there is also marked heterogeneity in the studies\\'designs, conduct, length of follow - up, types of participants, and periodontal treatment protocols. effects of periodontal disease on glycemic control and diabetes - related complications abbreviations : rct, randomized controlled trial ; non - rct, non - randomized controlled trial - treatment study ; d, days ; wk, weeks ; m, months ; y, years ; hba1 c, glycated hemoglobin - pd= periodontal disease - dm = diabetes mellitus - t1 d = diabetes mellitus type 1 - t2d = diabetes mellitus type 2 - gdm = gestational diabetes mellitus evidence regarding the effects of pd on glycemic control comes from observational and treatment studies ( figure 3 ). the treatment studies are a set of reports that include ten randomized clinical trials ( rcts ), twelve non - rcts, four meta - analyses, one literature review, one longitudinal study, one transversal study, one retrospective study, one prospective study and two clinical cases discussions. the rcts used control groups that were either treated controls, non - treated controls or controls that did not change their usual dental care. among the ten rcts, eight reported a beneficial effect for periodontal therapy and two did not. one of the rcts, recently conducted, showed significant improvement in hba1c levels but did not result in a statistically significant improvement in serum levels of inflammatory markers such as hs - crp, d-8-iso, mmp-2 and mmp-9. an important source of variation in the rcts is the use of antibiotics with the non - surgical periodontal therapy. this fact brings a lot of confusion in the interpretation of the results of these trials in such a way, that to date, there is no clear evidence to support a requirement for the use of antibiotics in combination with non - surgical periodontal treatment in order to observe an improvement in glycemic control associated with periodontal therapy. among the group of twenty - three periodontal treatment studies that were not rcts, like the rcts, there was marked variation in the use of adjunctive antibiotics, with six of the eight studies that used systemic antibiotics reporting a beneficial effect on glycemic control. additional evidence to support the effect of severe periodontitis on increased risk for poorer glycemic control comes from two longitudinal observational studies. a longitudinal epidemiological study of the pima indians in arizona, usa, which present the world\\'s highest reported prevalence of dm, found that subjects with t2d in good to moderate control and with severe periodontitis at baseline were approximately six times more likely to have poor glycemic control at a 2-year follow - up than those without severe periodontitis at baseline. ( 1998 ) in another observational study of 25 adults with t2d, aged 58 - 77 years, also reported an association between advanced periodontal disease and impaired metabolic control. recently, some important trials have recognized that poor glycemic control is a major determinant for the development of the chronic complications of dm. the diabetes control and complications trial, the epidemiology of diabetes interventions and complications ( edic ) trial, the long - term follow - up study of the dcct, both conducted with t1d and the united kingdom prospective diabetes study ( ukpds ) conducted with t2d, demonstrated that attaining and maintaining good glycemic control could reduce the risk for and/or postpone the progression of micro - vascular complications in patients with t1d and t2d. initially, the ukpds observed a statistically non significant 16% reduction ( p=0.052 ) in the risk of combined fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden death. recently, it was observed that a long - standing good metabolic control can bring significant long - term consequences including the reduction in the risks of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden death. the epidemiological analysis from the ukpds showed a continuous association between the risk of cardiovascular complications and glycemic control ; every percentage point decrease in hba1c, was associated with a 25% reduction in diabetes - related deaths, 7% reduction in all - cause mortality, and a 18% reduction in combined fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction. some observational studies regarding the association between pd and the risk for dm complications have given strong evidence for this association. in a study conducted in sweden, with 39 case - control pairs of individuals with t1d and t2d for a median follow - up time of six years, thorstensson, et al. ( 1996 ) observed a significantly higher prevalence of proteinuria and cardiovascular complications such as stroke, transient ischemic attacks, angina, myocardial infarction and intermittent claudication in the case group than in controls. these findings suggest that an association between renal disease, cardiovascular disease and its complications and severe periodontitis seems to exist. ( 2005 ), studied the contribution of pd to the mortality associated with t2d in the gila river indian community in arizona, usa, on behalf of the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases, addressing nephropathy and cardiovascular disease. this was a prospective longitudinal study with a cohort of 628 individuals, aged approximately 35 years old, for a median follow - up of eleven years ( range 0.3 to 16 ). during the study period individuals with severe pd had 3.2 times greater risk for cardio - renal mortality ( i.e., ischemic heart disease and diabetic nephropathy combined ) compared with the reference group ( no, mild, or moderate pd combined ), after adjustment for several major risk factors of cardio - renal mortality such as age, sex, diabetes duration, hba1c, body mass index ( bmi ), hypertension, blood glucose, cholesterol, electrocardiographic abnormalities, macro - albuminuria, and smoking. ( 2007 ), in the same community investigated the effect of periodontitis on overt nephropathy and end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) in a group of 529 subjects with t2d, aged approximately 25 years old. after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes duration, bmi, and smoking, they found that periodontitis and edentulism were significantly associated with the risk of overt nephropathy and esrd. the incidence of macro - albuminuria was 2.0, 2.1, and 2.6 times greater in individuals with moderate or severe periodontitis or in those who were edentulous, respectively, than those with none / mild periodontitis. the incidence of esrd was also 2.3, 3.5, and 4.9 times greater for individuals with moderate or severe periodontitis or for those who were edentulous, respectively, than those with none / mild periodontitis. the clinical and epidemiological evidence found in the literature we reviewed provides support for the concept that dm can have adverse effects on pd, that pd worsens in parallel with glycemic control and finally that pd is associated with an increase in the risk for diabetes - related complications. however, further prospective, rigorous, controlled trials with a larger number of patients, in ethnically diverse populations are warranted to establish these relationships and that treating pd can positively influence glycemic control and possibly reduce the burden of diabetes - related complications.'},\n",

release phase ) and the second phase ( 10 - 60 minutes ; de novo biosynthesis phase ) . \\n obviously , the data presented in figure 2 shows the second phase of insulin response . \\n a dose of 400 ml of this beverage given to patients ready to undergo a surgery increased serum insulin to levels seen after a standard mixed meal , thereby providing enough energy to switch the patient from the fasted to the fed state before the onset of the surgery.12 fasting from the previous evening inhibited insulin secretion and the glycolysis system was enhanced in the morning of the operation day , resulting in an increase in the plasma glucose level . in the cho group , \\n intake of carbohydrate - rich drink prevented the increase in the plasma glucose level by endogenous release of insulin . \\n this , in turn , resulted in a less stressful response to the surgical trauma and improved insulin sensitivity postoperatively . in patients undergoing abdominal surgery , \\n spinal anesthesia has been shown to produce efficient afferent blockade which resulted in pronounced reduction of the metabolic - endocrine response and improved insulin sensitivity.1314 in the control group , the observed increase in glucose concentrations together with a reduction in insulin concentrations did not exactly indicate the loss of normal insulin sensitivity . \\n it may suggest reduced release or increased turnover rate of insulin due to perioperative hypo - caloric nutrition or reduction in whole body glucose disposal , or both.15 in the cho group , intake of morning drink before the spinal anesthesia improved map just before and after the spinal anesthesia . although the present study was not designed to elucidate the factors responsible for the stable map levels in the cho group \\n , we can only speculate on the underlying endocrine mechanisms like improved glucose and insulin responses and the patients feeling more at ease during this period due to energy intake with carbohydrates . in conclusion , \\n preparation with oral carbohydrate before spinal anesthesia had advantages over overnight fasting during the perioperative period by increasing patient well - being , improving insulin response and stabilizing mean arterial pressure in patients undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair surgery . \\n hya carried out the design and coordinated the study , participated in most of the experiments and prepared the manuscript .\",\n",

9 ] . \\n above of all , they provide an important improvement in the field of power consumption : due to the bistability of the pigments , an image is retained on the display without the need for constant refreshment . \\n their properties make them the most likely candidate in the search for a display that combines the benefits of printed paper and an image display . \\n epds are now used in consumer products such as the amazon kindle or sony e -

13 ] . \\n the change in the appearance of a pixel of the epds is solely due to the change of the position of the pigments within the suspension . \\n thus , the pigments play a vital role on the speed and efficiency of the epds . for a white / black display cell , \\n the white particles are typically titanium oxide because of its relatively high refractive index of 2.7 , which leads to excellent scattering properties . \\n generally , carbon black is the material of choice to produce the black color in most applications . \\n however , carbon black has a complex and poorly understood surface chemistry , which may vary widely with the specific raw material and the exact process used for the carbon black production . \\n it has also been discovered that carbon black has a low density ( 0.8 g / cm ) , which is not matched to that of the usual suspending medium ( about 1.7 g / cm ) . \\n there is thus a need for black particle with proper density and surface chemistry for used in epds that can be compatible with the suspending fluid . \\n herein , we demonstrate that carbon  iron oxide microspheres black pigments ( ciombs ) are formed via ultrasonic spray pyrolysis of the aqueous solutions containing fecl2 and glucose . \\n different from the formation process of carbon powders , in situ -

       "  'model_output': 'electrophoretic displays ( epds ) have been the subject of intense research and development for a number of years [ 1 - 5 ]. in such displays, pigments are dispersed as a colloidal suspension in a colored solvent, which is placed in a narrow space between two transparent electrodes. by applying an electric field to the suspension, the charged pigments can be moved through the fluid. when the field is applied in one direction, the pigments move toward the observer and the pixel has the color of the pigments. when the field is applied in the opposite direction, the ito electrode closest to the observer is covered with colored solvent. just like printed paper, epds are lightweight, flexible and easy to read in all lighting conditions [ 6 - 9 ]. above of all, they provide an important improvement in the field of power consumption : due to the bistability of the pigments, an image is retained on the display without the need for constant refreshment. their properties make them the most likely candidate in the search for a display that combines the benefits of printed paper and an image display. epds are now used in consumer products such as the amazon kindle or sony e - reader. nevertheless, problems with the long - term image quality of the displays have prevented their widespread usage. for example, pigments that make up epds tend to settle, resulting in inadequate service life for the displays [ 10 - 13 ]. the change in the appearance of a pixel of the epds is solely due to the change of the position of the pigments within the suspension. thus, the pigments play a vital role on the speed and efficiency of the epds. for a white / black display cell, the white particles are typically titanium oxide because of its relatively high refractive index of 2.7, which leads to excellent scattering properties. generally, carbon black is the material of choice to produce the black color in most applications. however, carbon black has a complex and poorly understood surface chemistry, which may vary widely with the specific raw material and the exact process used for the carbon black production. it has also been discovered that carbon black has a low density ( 0.8 g / cm ), which is not matched to that of the usual suspending medium ( about 1.7 g / cm ). there is thus a need for black particle with proper density and surface chemistry for used in epds that can be compatible with the suspending fluid. herein, we demonstrate that carbon  iron oxide microspheres black pigments ( ciombs ) are formed via ultrasonic spray pyrolysis of the aqueous solutions containing fecl2 and glucose. different from the formation process of carbon powders, in situ - formed iron oxide nanoparticles are introduced as surface chemistry and density modification component to form carbon  iron oxide composites. the density of the ciombs can be easily tuned in the range of 1.52.2 g / cm by acid etching, which resolved the problem of mismatched density between carbon -

       "  'input': \"solitary fibrous tumors ( sfts ) are soft tissue neoplasms that usually originate from the pleura , but occasionally they originate from other regions , including the retroperitoneum and pelvis [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . \\n approximately 80% of all sfts are located in the thoracic cavity , while the remaining 20% are found in various regions , including the retroperitoneum [ 4 , 5 ] . although sfts are typically benign , they can be malignant , especially if they grow to a large size or in case of repeated recurrence [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] . \\n non - islet cell tumor hypoglycemia ( nicth ) is rare but associated with various tumor types , including sft [ 9 , 10 ] . \\n approximately 4% of all sfts are associated with hypoglycemia . in most patients with nicth , \\n a high - molecular - weight form of insulin - like growth factor ii ( igf - ii ) derived from the tumor causes hypoglycemia . \\n the structure of the normal - molecular - weight form of igf - ii is similar to that of pro - insulin and has a hypoglycemic effect . \\n the incompletely processed precursor of igf - ii , the so - called high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii , has a strong insulin - like effect and more strongly induces hypoglycemia than normal igf - ii . \\n therefore , elevated serum and tissue levels of the high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii are useful in the diagnosis of nicth . \\n herein , we report a case of nicth caused by recurrent malignant sft in the retroperitoneum and pelvis that produced a high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii . \\n an 83-year - old man had the first surgery for sft in the retroperitoneum in 2006 . \\n immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor was composed of patternless cellular proliferation and was stained positive for cd34 and bcl-2 but negative for -smooth muscle , desmin , s-100 protein , and c - kit ( fig . \\n therefore , we diagnosed sft with high malignant potential and a high risk of recurrence and metastasis . \\n the tumor recurred in the retroperitoneum and pelvis in 2010 , and we again performed complete resection . since this tumor had similar histological and macroscopic findings , we diagnosed local recurrence of malignant sft . in these 2 perioperative periods , \\n the cause of these repeated syncopal attacks was thought to be hypoglycemia . on admission , \\n serum insulin was undetectable ( normal range 2.212.4 u / ml ) , c - peptide was 0.1 ng / ml ( normal range 0.82.5 ng / ml ) , and glucose was very low . \\n serum levels of thyroid hormones and cortisol were within normal ranges ( free triiodothyronine 2.2 pg / ml , free tetraiodothyronine 1.3 pg / ml , thyroid - stimulating hormone 1.2 iu / ml , cortisol 16.4 g / dl ) . \\n furthermore , hba1c ( 5.1% ) , growth hormone ( 0.15 ng / ml ) , and igf binding protein-3 ( 0.6 g / ml ) were all within normal ranges . \\n abdominal computed tomography ( ct ) showed a sequentially lobulated tumor in the retroperitoneum from close to the left common iliac artery to the pelvis ( fig . \\n colonoscopy showed that the lower rectum was compressed , but the mucosa appeared normal . based on these findings , insulinoma , insulin autoimmune syndrome , and adrenal insufficiency were excluded . \\n finally , at the second recurrence , we diagnosed nicth caused by malignant sft in the retroperitoneum and pelvis . \\n we performed complete resection of the recurrent tumors in june 2011 , combined with resection of portions of the rectum and bladder , which was necessary because of severe adhesion . to prevent bowel obstruction due to further recurrence in the pelvic cavity , we avoided anastomosis of the rectum and performed a colostomy at the sigmoid colon . \\n the tumor was a solid , elastic , lobulated mass with hemorrhagic and necrotic changes ( fig . 2c ) . \\n histological findings were similar to those of the previously excised tumors , which showed patternless proliferation of the cells ( fig . \\n 25 mitoses per 10 hpf were observed , suggesting the presence of high - grade malignancy . \\n serum levels glucose , insulin , and c - peptide were 143 mg / dl , 11.4 u / ml , and 2.5 ng / ml , respectively ;

       "  'model_output': \"solitary fibrous tumors ( sfts ) are soft tissue neoplasms that usually originate from the pleura, but occasionally they originate from other regions, including the retroperitoneum and pelvis [ 1, 2, 3 ]. \\n approximately 80% of all sfts are located in the thoracic cavity, while the remaining 20% are found in various regions, including the retroperitoneum [ 4, 5 ]. although sfts are typically benign, they can be malignant, especially if they grow to a large size or in case of repeated recurrence [ 6, 7, 8 ]. \\n non - islet cell tumor hypoglycemia ( nicth ) is rare but associated with various tumor types, including sft [ 9, 10 ]. \\n approximately 4% of all sfts are associated with hypoglycemia. in most patients with nicth, \\n a high - molecular - weight form of insulin - like growth factor ii ( igf - ii ) derived from the tumor causes hypoglycemia. \\n the structure of the normal - molecular - weight form of igf - ii is similar to that of pro - insulin and has a hypoglycemic effect. \\n the incompletely processed precursor of igf - ii, the so - called high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii, has a strong insulin - like effect and more strongly induces hypoglycemia than normal igf - ii. \\n therefore, elevated serum and tissue levels of the high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii are useful in the diagnosis of nicth. \\n herein, we report a case of nicth caused by recurrent malignant sft in the retroperitoneum and pelvis that produced a high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii. \\n an 83-year - old man had the first surgery for sft in the retroperitoneum in 2006. \\n immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor was composed of patternless cellular proliferation and was stained positive for cd34 and bcl-2 but negative for -smooth muscle, desmin, s-100 protein, and c - kit ( fig. \\n therefore, we diagnosed sft with high malignant potential and a high risk of recurrence and metastasis. \\n the tumor recurred in the retroperitoneum and pelvis in 2010, and we again performed complete resection. since this tumor had similar histological and macroscopic findings, we diagnosed local recurrence of malignant sft. in these 2 perioperative periods, \\n the cause of these repeated syncopal attacks was thought to be hypoglycemia. on admission, \\n serum insulin was undetectable ( normal range 2.212.4 u / ml ), c - peptide was 0.1 ng / ml ( normal range 0.82.5 ng / ml ), and glucose was very low. \\n serum levels of thyroid hormones and cortisol were within normal ranges ( free triiodothyronine 2.2 pg / ml, free tetraiodothyronine 1.3 pg / ml, thyroid - stimulating hormone 1.2 iu / ml, cortisol 16.4 g / dl ). \\n furthermore, hba1c ( 5.1% ), growth hormone ( 0.15 ng / ml ), and igf binding protein-3 ( 0.6 g / ml ) were all within normal ranges. \\n abdominal computed tomography ( ct ) showed a sequentially lobulated tumor in the retroperitoneum from close to the left common iliac artery to the pelvis ( fig. \\n colonoscopy showed that the lower rectum was compressed, but the mucosa appeared normal. based on these findings, insulinoma, insulin autoimmune syndrome, and adrenal insufficiency were excluded. \\n finally, at the second recurrence, we diagnosed nicth caused by malignant sft in the retroperitoneum and pelvis. \\n we performed complete resection of the recurrent tumors in june 2011, combined with resection of portions of the rectum and bladder, which was necessary because of severe adhesion. to prevent bowel obstruction due to further recurrence in the pelvic cavity, we avoided anastomosis of the rectum and performed a colostomy at the sigmoid colon. \\n the tumor was a solid, elastic, lobulated mass with hemorrhagic and necrotic changes ( fig. 2c ). \\n histological findings were similar to those of the previously excised tumors, which showed patternless proliferation of the cells ( fig. \\n 25 mitoses per 10 hpf were observed, suggesting the presence of high - grade malignancy. \\n serum levels glucose, insulin, and c - peptide were 143 mg / dl, 11.4 u / ml, and 2.5 ng / ml, respectively ; therefore, all these levels recovered to their normal ranges. \\n immunoblotting analysis was performed to investigate the heterogeneity of igf - ii in serum and the excised tumor. \\n the normal - molecular - weight form of igf - ii ( 7.5 kda ) was not detected in serum from a normal healthy control or from the patient. \\n in contrast, a high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii ( 13 kda ) was detected in the patient's serum before the surgery, and it disappeared after the surgery ( fig. \\n furthermore, immunoblotting analysis of protein extracted from paraffin - embedded tumor specimens showed that the high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii was not detected in the first tumor removed in 2006 or the first recurrence removed in 2010, but it was detected in 2011, at the second recurrence ( fig. \\n the patient had an uneventful postoperative course and did not suffer from any additional hypoglycemic attacks. however, \\n 1 year after the last surgery, a small local recurrent tumor was detected in the pelvis. \\n although we planned and recommended further intensive examination and treatment, informed consent was not obtained because the patient was doing well and had no signs of hypoglycemia. \\n almost all sfts have been reported in the pleura, but they have also been rarely reported in other sites, including the liver, kidney, retroperitoneum, and soft tissues. \\n goodlad and fletcher   reported that 6% of all sfts originated from the pelvis. in our case \\n, the large tumor removed during the first surgery in 2006 was not connected to the gastrointestinal tract or the peritoneum and was thought to have originated from the retroperitoneum. \\n although nearly all sfts have low malignant potential, malignancy can occur, especially if they grow to a large size or in case of repeated recurrence [ 6, 14 ]. \\n described high cellularity, high mitotic activity ( more than 4 mitoses per 10 hpf ), pleomorphism, necrosis, and hemorrhagic changes as the criteria for malignancy. \\n based on these criteria, all three excised specimens in our case were considered histologically malignant sfts. \\n interestingly, the number of mitoses per 10 hpf was 3 in 2006, 15 in 2010, and 25 in 2011. \\n in other words, in the tumors removed from successive surgeries, more mitoses per 10 hpf were detected. \\n in fact, malignant transformation in recurrence of previously benign sft has been reported [ 7, 8 ]. \\n nicth is a cause of hypoglycemia ; approximately 4% of all sfts are associated with hypoglycemia, and nicth develops because of the production of a high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii, which is an incompletely processed igf - ii that has greater bioavailability than normal igf - ii. in our case \\n, no hypoglycemic attacks occurred in the past two perioperative periods in 2006 and 2010. because nicth first occurred at the second recurrence \\n, we suspect that the tumor had newly acquired the capability of producing a high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii. \\n to clarify this hypothesis, immunoblotting analysis was performed. because serum igf - ii is not always elevated in patients with igf - ii - producing nicth, it is important to detect the high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii by immunoblotting. \\n preoperative analysis of the patient's serum revealed the presence of a high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii ( 13 kda ), and postoperative analysis revealed the absence of it. \\n furthermore, the high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii was only present in the tumor excised in 2011 but not in those excised in 2006 and 2010. in all serum samples \\n tested, including one healthy control, normal igf - ii ( 7.5 kda ) was not detected. \\n we thought that the reason for this result was either the very low amount of endogenous normal igf - ii in this study or the loss of integrity of the protein during the extract purification process. in summary, we reported a rare case of nicth caused by a high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii produced by the second recurrent malignant sft in the retroperitoneum and pelvis. \\n although several cases of nicth with malignant sft in the pelvis have been reported, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a nicth at the second recurrence of malignant sft. with repeated recurrence, \\n the sft obtained high malignant potential and a new phenotype of hypoglycemia caused by the production of a high - molecular - weight form of igf - ii as one type of acquired transformation. \\n symptoms of hypoglycemia should be carefully monitored during treatment and long - term follow - up for sft.\"},\n",

style related diseases such as diabetes and hypertension compared to those without new stroke evidence . \\n the relationship between hdlc levels and groups of lacunar infarction was evaluated by multiple comparisons ( lsd - t ) in table 2 . \\n 1 ) the plasma levels of hldl in group bobi , ai&sobi , and ai&bobi were higher than in the control group , and were lower in group sobi than in the control group ( p<0.01 ) . \\n 2 ) the plasma levels of hldl in group ai&sobi were significantly higher than in group sobi ( p<0.01 ) . \\n after adjusting for these factors such as age , sex , tg , tc , ldlc , and history of diabetes , multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that there were significant relationships between hdlc and different lacunar stroke groups ( p=0.001 ) ( table 3 ) . in the current study , carried out on middle - aged and elderly subjects , we investigated the associations of hdlc with the presence of li , and found that patients with lower hdlc levels mostly had obsolete brain infarctions single side . \\n these findings changed when these patients with obsolete brain infarctions single side had a recurrent acute stroke . \\n further analyses showed that higher hdlc levels were also associated with acute stroke in obsolete brain infarctions bilateral sides . \\n we demonstrated that higher hdlc was associated with an increased risk of recurrent acute period of li . \\n this might provide an adverse perspective of the previously observed association between decreased serum levels of hdlc and stroke in elderly adults . \\n variables that correlated with the groups ( p<0.05 ) were included in multinomial logistic regression analysis , which showed that higher hdlc was associated with a greater risk of recurrent li in the ai&sobi and ai&bobi groups . \\n a similar result was observed with the levels of hdlc in group bobi . by contrast \\n lis are believed to share similar pathogenic mechanisms ; they may be of cardio - embolic origin , or caused by atherosclerotic processes taking place mostly in the small vessel walls and vascular risk factors , such as in advanced age , hypertension [ 2022 ] , metabolic syndrome , and coronary artery disease . \\n multiple mechanisms of cerebral infarction caused by atherosclerosis have been proposed , including intravascular thrombosis , vascular stenosis , and reduced perfusion pressure in terminal cerebral vessels . \\n in addition , the current study identified that numerous factors  including age , lipoprotein , glycosylated hemoglobin and blood parameters , and diabetes  were correlated with the severity of atherosclerosis , plaque formation , and artery stenosis [ 15,18,19,2529 ] . \\n it appears that the main protective mechanisms of hdlc are reversing cholesterol transport , anti - inflammatory , antioxidant , and , more generally , endothelial protective effects [ 3040 ] . \\n previous studies inferred that by increasing the concentration of hdlc might achieve favorable effects for stroke [ 2022 ] . \\n a low hdlc is part of the well recognized metabolic syndrome , which is clearly associated with vascular events in western populations ( but whether hdlc has a protective effect on stroke is inconclusive ) , not to mention in asian populations who have different dietary habits and hdlc levels . \\n a study by gu et al . in a chinese population showed that patients with the cetp-692a / c polymorphism cc genotype had better lipid - regulating effects , exactly opposite to results of a study in germany . \\n our results mostly suggest that among the chinese population , hdlc levels are dramatically lower in patients with obsolete brain infarctions single side than in control groups ; however , when these patients develop an acute stroke , their hdlc levels are tremendously higher than in control groups . \\n we infer that the main mechanism of li single side may be intravascular thrombosis , while the main mechanism of li bilateral sides may be vascular stenosis and reduced perfusion pressure in terminal cerebral vessels , because atherosclerosis tends to be a systemic vascular system status , with infarctions always scattered and not concentrated on a single side . \\n we found that plasma hldl was independently associated with recurrent li with obsolete brain infarction single side , suggesting it may be an independent predictor of , as well as a predictive factor for , li in chinese people , justifying clinical trials for secondary prevention of stroke by generally increasing hldl level . \\n the difference between single and bilateral side multiple silent lacunar infarcts suggests that higher hdlc levels may increase the risk of intravascular thrombolic infarction but reduce the risk of atherothrombotic infarction in the general chinese population . in atherothrombotic infarction \\n , we found that the role of hdlc is consistent with findings of previous studies . \\n the results of the present study indicate that the hdlc plays different roles in acute phase recurrent li with single / bilateral chronic infarction . \\n the strengths of this study included the consecutive study design with a relatively large sample size , multiple groups , and comparisons of different patterns . \\n however , this study also had limitations in that it was not based on the general population , and the results may be influenced by the limited representativeness of the sample selected from hospitalized patients .',\n",

       "  'input': \"more than 95% of the ethanol produced today is from simple biomass like mono- and disaccharides and starch . \\n the use of this type of biomass has been increasingly debated due to its impact on food and feed prices as well as for environmental reasons . \\n therefore , complex ( lignocellulosic ) biomass has been put forward as a feasible alternative due to its abundance in nature and the large quantities generated as waste from agricultural activities [ 2 , 3 ] . \\n cellulose and hemicellulose are the main substrates used for ethanol production , but lignin is composed of aromatic lignols that need to be separated and removed before enzymatic hydrolysis . today , expensive pretreatments are the main reason for unsuccessful implementation of complex lignocellulosic biomasses as a starting material for ethanol production . \\n the best - known microorganisms used for ethanol production today are the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and the bacterium zymomonas mobilis . \\n both organisms have very high yields of ethanol ( > 1.9  mol ethanol / mol hexose ) but very narrow substrate spectra and thus are not suitable for ethanol production from complex substrates . \\n therefore , the use of thermophilic bacteria with broad substrate range and high yields may be a better option for ethanol production from complex biomasses . \\n it has been known for some time now that many thermophilic bacteria are highly efficient ethanol producers . \\n after the oil crisis in the 1980s , there was a peak in investigations on thermophilic ethanol - producing bacteria ; bacteria within the genera of thermoanaerobacterium , thermoanaerobacter , and clostridium have demonstrated good ethanol yields and fast growth rates [ 58 ] . \\n there are several advantages in using these thermophilic bacteria : the increased temperature deters contamination from mesophilic bacteria and fungi , possible self - distillation of ethanol avoiding the generally low ethanol tolerance problem with those bacteria , and broad substrate spectrum [ 9 , 10 ] . some of these strains produce more than 1.5  mol ethanol / mol hexose [ 1116 ] , whereas the theoretical maximum yield is 2.0  mol ethanol / mol hexose degraded . \\n the main reasons for low yields are the formation of other end products such as acetate , butyrate , and co2 [ 1116 ] . \\n the present study focuses on a recently isolated thermophilic bacterium , strain j1 , which is most closely related to species within the genus thermoanaerobacter . \\n bacteria within this genus seem to be among the most efficient ethanol producers known and show very high yields from simple sugar fermentations [ 1214 , 16 ] as well as from complex lignocellulosic biomass [ 10 , 13 , 1719 ] . \\n these bacteria are gram - variable rods with broad substrate spectrum ( mostly sugars ) and produces ethanol , acetate , lactate , hydrogen , and carbon dioxide during anaerobic fermentation [ 20 , 21 ] . \\n the physiological characteristics of thermoanaerobacter strain j1 , isolated from icelandic hot spring , were investigated in detail with the main aim of exploring the ethanol production capacity both from simple sugars as well as from various lignocellulosic biomass . \\n this medium , referred to as basal medium ( bm ) hereafter , contains yeast extract ( 2 \\n all experiments were performed at 65c at ph 7.0 without agitation with the exception of the temperature and ph optimum experiments . \\n the inoculum volume was 2% ( v / v ) in all experiments which were always performed in duplicates . \\n the strain was isolated in bm with glucose ( 20  mm ) from a hot spring ( 69c , ph 7.5 ) in grensdalur in southwest of iceland . \\n samples were enriched on glucose , and positive samples ( increase in growth and production of hydrogen ) were reinoculated five times . from the final enrichment series , end point dilutions were performed by using bm containing agar ( 30  gl ) . \\n isolation of the hydrogenotrophic methane producing strain has been described elsewhere . to determine the strain 's growth characteristics at various phs and temperatures , \\n the strain was cultivated on glucose ( 20  mm ) , and cell concentration was measured by increase in absorbance at 600  nm by a perkin - elmer lambda 25 uv - vis spectrophotometer . maximum ( specific ) growth rate ( max ) for each experiment was derived from absorbance data . for ph optimum experiments , \\n the initial ph was set to various levels in the range from 3.0 to 9.0 with increments of 1.0 ph unit . \\n the experimental bottles were supplemented with acid ( hcl ) and alkali ( naoh ) to set the ph accordingly . to determine the optimum temperature for growth , the incubation temperature varied from 35c to 80c . for the ph optimum experiments , \\n the strain was cultivated at 65c , and for the temperature optimum experiments , the ph was 7.0 . \\n experiments were done in 117.5  ml serum bottles with 50  ml liquid medium . \\n full 16s rrna analysis of 1479-nucleotide long sequence was done according to orlygsson and baldursson   and references therein . \\n sequences from 16s rrna analysis were compared to sequences in the ncbi database using the nucleotide - nucleotide blast ( blast - n ) tool . \\n the most similar sequences were aligned with the sequencing results in the programs bioedit   and clustal_x . \\n the effect of initial glucose concentration on strain j1 , by varying the concentration from 5 to 200  mm , was tested . \\n glucose , hydrogen , acetate , and ethanol concentrations were measured at the beginning and at the end of incubation time ( 7 days ) . \\n experiments were done in 117.5  ml serum bottles with 60  ml liquid medium , and the ph was measured at the end of incubation time . \\n the ability of strain j1 to utilize different substrates was tested using the bm medium supplemented with various carbon substrates ( xylose , arabinose , glucose , mannose , galactose , fructose , rhamnose , maltose , cellobiose , sucrose , lactose , trehalose , raffinose , starch , cellulose , cmc , avicel , xylan ( from oat spelt ) , glycerol , pyruvate , serine , and threonine ) . \\n all substrates were added from filter - sterilized ( 0.45  m ) substrates except for xylan , starch , cmc , cellulose , and avicel which were autoclaved with the medium . in all cases , \\n the concentration of substrates was 20  mm except for xylan , starch , cmc , cellulose , and avicel when 2  gl was used . \\n experiments were performed in 24.5  ml serum bottles with 10  ml liquid medium . \\n hydrolysates ( hls ) were made from different biomasses : whatman no . 1 filter paper , newspaper , hemp stem ( cannabis sativa ) , barley straw ( hordeum vulgare ) , and grass ( phleum pratense ) . \\n hydrolysates were prepared according to sveinsdottir et al . , and the final concentration of each biomass type was 22.5  gl . \\n biomass was pretreated chemically by using 0.50% ( v / v ) of acid ( h2so4 ) or alkali ( naoh ) ( control was without chemical pretreatment ) before heating ( 121c , 60  min ) . \\n two commercial enzyme solutions , celluclast ( novozyme , 750  ug ) and novozyme 188 ( sigma c6105 , 200  ug ) , were added to each bottle after chemical pretreatment ; the bottles were cooled down to room temperature and the ph adjusted to 5.0 before enzymes were added . \\n the hydrolysates were incubated in water bath at 45c for 68  h. after the enzyme treatment , the ph was adjusted with naoh or hcl to ph 7.0 which is the ph optimum of the strain . \\n the hydrolysates were then filtered ( whatman - weibrand ; 0.45  m ) into sterile bottles .   in one set of experiments , \\n strain j1 was incubated on glucose ( 20  mm ) in the presence of sodium thiosulfate ( 40  mm ) and in coculture with a hydrogenotrophic methanogen . \\n the methanogen was precultivated in bm medium with a gas phase consisting of 80% of h2 and 20% of co2 for one week . \\n then the experimental culture bottles were flushed with nitrogen prior to the addition of glucose ( 20  mm ) and strain j1 . \\n fermentation of carbohydrates present in the hydrolysates after chemical and enzymatic pretreatment was performed in 24.5  ml serum bottles . \\n the bm medium and inoculum ( 8.0  ml ) were supplemented with different hydrolysates ( 2.0  ml , total liquid volume of 10  ml ) giving a final hydrolysate concentration of 4.5  gl . \\n hydrogen , ethanol , and volatile fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography as previously described . \\n glucose was determined by slight modification of the method from laurentin and edwards ; supernatant broth ( 400  l ) was mixed with 2  ml of anthrone solution ( 0.2% ( w / v ) of anthrone in 72% ( v / v ) of sulphuric acid ) . \\n absorbance was then measured at 600  nm by using perkin - elmer lambda 25 uv - vis spectrophotometer . \\n figure 1 shows that strain j1 belongs to the genus thermoanaerobacter with its closest neighbours being t. uzonensis ( 97.7% homology ) and t. sulfurigenes ( 95.5% ) . \\n the genus thermoanaerobacter falls into clusters v in the phylogenetic interrelationship of clostridium according to collins and coworkers . \\n all species within the genus are obligate anaerobes and ferment various carbohydrates to ethanol , acetate , lactate , hydrogen , and carbon dioxide , while some species can degrade amino acids . \\n today , the genus consists of 18 species according to the euzeby list of prokaryotes . \\n the strain was able to grow between 55.0c and 75.0c with optimal temperature being 65.0c ( max ; 0.23  h ) . \\n one of the main reasons for increased interest in using thermophilic bacteria for second - generation ethanol production is because of their broad substrate spectrum . \\n therefore , it was decided to cultivate the strain on the most common sugars present in lignocellulosic biomass as well as pyruvate , glycerol , serine , and threonine ( figure 2 ) . \\n clearly , the strain is a very powerful ethanol producer ; it produces 1.70  mol ethanol / mol glucose and 1.25  mol ethanol / mol xylose ( control values subtracted ) or 85.0 and 75.0% of theoretical yields , respectively . \\n the following stoichiometry from glucose and xylose was observed : \\n ( 1)1.0  glucose1.70  etoh+0.15  acetate+0.30  h2 + 1.85  co2(2)1.0  xylose1.25  etoh+0.20  acetate+0.20 \\n h2 + 1.45  co2 lactate was not analysed in the present paper , but high carbon recoveries from analysed end products from glucose and xylose ( 92.5 and 87.4% , resp . ) \\n the substrate spectrum of the strain shows a broad capacity in degrading pentoses ( xylose , arabinose ) , hexoses ( glucose , mannose , galactose , fructose , and rhamnose ) , disaccharides ( maltose , cellobiose , lactose , trehalose , and sucrose ) the trisaccharide raffinose , and starch , pyruvate , and serine . in all the cases , the major end product is ethanol except for serine and pyruvate in which acetate is the primary end product . \\n the highest ethanol concentrations were produced from the trisaccharide raffinose ( 75.2  mm ) . \\n as earlier mentioned , the strain is most closely related to t. uzonensis ( strain jw / iw010 ) which also produces ethanol and acetate as the only volatile end products , but the ratio between ethanol and acetate is 1.35 in that strain . \\n however , t. uzonensis has a more narrow sugar degradation spectrum as compared to strain j1 ; it can not degrade arabinose and rhamnose . \\n other well - known ethanol producers within the genus are t. ethanolicus , t. thermohydrosulfuricus , and t. finnii with yields between 1.5 and 1.9  mol ethanol / mol glucose [ 11 , 13 , 14 , 29 ] . during growth on serine and pyruvate , \\n this can be explained by the oxidation state of these substrates as compared to sugars ; the oxidation state of the carbon in glucose is zero , and during its oxidation to pyruvate , the electrons are transferred to nad leading to the formation of nadh . \\n reoxidation of nadh to nad by the strain occurs most likely through acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase rendering ethanol as the main product . \\n however , both pyruvate and serine are more oxidized substrates as compared to sugars ( glucose ) , and there is no need to reoxidize nadh . \\n instead , the strain deaminates serine directly to pyruvate which is decarboxylated to acetyl phosphate ( by phosphotransacetylase ) and further to acetate ( by acetate kinase ) resulting in atp formation . \\n however , since hydrogen production is less as compared to acetate , it is likely that the strain is also producing formate ( not analyzed ) instead of hydrogen from these substrates . \\n high initial substrate concentrations may inhibit substrate utilization and/or decrease end product yields [ 5 , 10 , 30 ] . \\n in closed systems , such as batch cultures , the limited buffer capacity of the medium may be overloaded by the accumulation of organic acids resulting in a ph drop and the inhibition of substrate fermentation utilization . to investigate the influence of initial substrate concentration on end product formation , changes in ph , and substrate degradation , strain j1 was cultivated with different concentration of glucose ( 0 to 200  mm ) . \\n the strain completely degraded glucose in all experiments , except for the highest ( 200  mm ) initial glucose loadings , and ethanol yields were between 1.2 and 1.7  mol ethanol / mol glucose ( figure 3 ) . \\n acetate formation increased from 2.7  mm in control bottles ( without glucose ) to 9.5  mm at 100  mm glucose concentrations which was directly linked to a decrease from ph 7.0 ( control ) to 5.2 ( 100  mm glucose ) . at 200  mm \\n glucose concentrations , acetate was only slightly higher as compared to 100  mm glucose concentrations , the ph dropped from 5.2 to 4.8 , and only 110  mm of glucose was degraded . \\n thus , the limit of glucose seems to be ph related , because of the formation of acetate , rather than substrate inhibition . \\n the strain seems to be more tolerant for initial substrate concentrations as compared to many other thermophilic bacteria where often a concentration between 20 and 30  mm is too high for a complete degradation [ 7 , 8 ] . in those cases , \\n however , more acetate was produced as compared to ethanol and may be crucial for lowering the ph at lower substrate concentrations .   it is well known that thermoanaerobacter species are highly flexible concerning end product formation depending on the culture conditions . \\n .   showed a dramatic shift in end product formation by thermoanaerobacter finnii when grown on glucose in the presence and absence of thiosulfate . in that case , both ethanol and lactate decreased during thiosulfate reduction to hydrogen sulphide , whereas the acetate concentration increased . \\n the influence of using biological hydrogen - scavenging systems has also been investigated throughout thermoanaerobacter brockii during amino acid degradation . \\n both thiosulfate and the presence of a hydrogen - scavenging methanogen were crucial for the oxidative deamination of the branched chain amino acids by this strain . however , degradation of a substrate that is thermodynamically easier to degrade , for example , the amino acid serine , was completely degraded in the presence and absence of thiosulfate and methanobacterium sp . \\n although a shift occurred between ethanol and acetate formation . to investigate the influence of low partial pressure ( ph2 ) on end product formation , strain j1 was cultivated in the presence of thiosulfate and in coculture with a hydrogenotrophic methanogen \\n as observed earlier , strain j1 produced ethanol as the main end product during glucose fermentation only ( table 1 ) . \\n the addition of thiosulfate to glucose fermentations resulted in a shift towards acetate from ethanol where the ratio between ethanol and acetate changed from 6.90 to 1.29 . \\n cocultivating strain j1 with a hydrogenotrophic methanogen led even to more dramatic shift towards acetate ( and methane ) , and the ratio of ethanol and acetate was 0.14 . \\n this difference in end product formation by using thiosulfate or a hydrogenotrophic methanogen is surprisingly big considering that the concentration of hydrogen is very low at the end of experimental time ( 0.3 to 0.5  mmoll ) in both cases . \\n this difference could be caused by more rapid uptake of hydrogen in the coculture experiment , but end products were only analysed at the end of the experimental time . the strain is producing maximally 33.9  mm ( 1.56 \\n the yields on cellulose pretreated only with enzymes and heat are 7.5  mmg dry weight ( dw ) which is considered lower as compared to glucose degradation alone ( 1.70  mol ethanol / mol glucose ; 9.4  mmg glucose ) . \\n thus , the lower ethanol yields on cellulose as compared to glucose indicate that the cellulose was not completely degraded during enzymatic hydrolysis . \\n chemical pretreatment of cellulose by the addition of acid or alkali did not increase the end product formation yields on cellulose . \\n the highest ethanol yields on the more complex biomass types ( without chemical pretreatment ) were observed on hemp ( 11.6  mm ; 2.6  mmg  dw ) but lowest on straw ( 3.5  mm ; 0.8  mmg  dw ) . \\n chemical pretreatment by adding either acid or alkali increased yields substantially on most of the lignocellulosic biomasses tested . \\n the increase was most profound on hydrolysates from straw pretreated with alkali where ethanol production was increased from 3.5 to 14.8  mm ( controls subtracted ) . \\n the highest ethanol yields were however observed on hemp , 4.3  mmg  dw ( 19.0  mm ) . \\n the highest ethanol yields by thermoanaerobacter species have been reported by continuous cultures of thermoanaerobacter strain bg1l1 on wheat straw   and corn stover , or 8.59.2  mmg sugar consumed . \\n thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus has been reported to produce 4.5 and 4.8  mm ethanolg hexose equivalent degraded from wood hydrolysate and beet molasses , respectively [ 13 , 32 ] . \\n thermoanaerobacter mathranii , isolated from the same geographical area in iceland   as strain j1 produced 5.3  mmg sugar from wheat straw hydrolysate . \\n recently , a new thermoanaerobacter strain , ak5 closely related to t. thermohydrosulfuricus and t. ethanolicus , was isolated from a hot spring in iceland and has similar yields on cellulose ( 7.7  mmg ) , hemp ( 3.1  mmg ) , and grass ( 4.1  mmg ) hydrolysates . \\n the main aim of the study was to investigate the importance of various factors on ethanol production from both sugars and complex lignocellulosic biomass . \\n the strain produces 1.70  mol ethanol / mol glucose and 1.25  mol ethanol / mol xylose and shows a broad substrate spectrum , degrading various sugars and starch but not cellulosic substrates . \\n high ethanol yields were observed at initial glucose concentrations up to 100  mm . during growth under hydrogen removal , a shift from ethanol to \\n the strain produces up to 7.5  mm ethanolg cellulose and 4.2  mmg hemp hydrolysate .\",\n",

it can not degrade arabinose and rhamnose. \\n other well - known ethanol producers within the genus are t. ethanolicus, t. thermohydrosulfuricus, and t. finnii with yields between 1.5 and 1.9  mol ethanol / mol glucose [ 11, 13, 14, 29 ]. during growth on serine and pyruvate, \\n this can be explained by the oxidation state of these substrates as compared to sugars ; the oxidation state of the carbon in glucose is zero, and during its oxidation to pyruvate, the electrons are transferred to nad leading to the formation of nadh. \\n reoxidation of nadh to nad by the strain occurs most likely through acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase rendering ethanol as the main product. \\n however, both pyruvate and serine are more oxidized substrates as compared to sugars ( glucose ), and there is no need to reoxidize nadh. \\n instead, the strain deaminates serine directly to pyruvate which is decarboxylated to acetyl phosphate ( by phosphotransacetylase ) and further to acetate ( by acetate kinase ) resulting in atp formation. \\n however, since hydrogen production is less as compared to acetate, it is likely that the strain is also producing formate ( not analyzed ) instead of hydrogen from these substrates. \\n high initial substrate concentrations may inhibit substrate utilization and/or decrease end product yields [ 5, 10, 30 ]. \\n in closed systems, such as batch cultures, the limited buffer capacity of the medium may be overloaded by the accumulation of organic acids resulting in a ph drop and the inhibition of substrate fermentation utilization. to investigate the influence of initial substrate concentration on end product formation, changes in ph, and substrate degradation, strain j1 was cultivated with different concentration of glucose ( 0 to 200  mm ). \\n the strain completely degraded glucose in all experiments, except for the highest ( 200  mm ) initial glucose loadings, and ethanol yields were between 1.2 and 1.7  mol ethanol / mol glucose ( figure 3 ). \\n acetate formation increased from 2.7  mm in control bottles ( without glucose ) to 9.5  mm at 100  mm glucose concentrations which was directly linked to a decrease from ph 7.0 ( control ) to 5.2 ( 100  mm glucose ). at 200  mm \\n glucose concentrations, acetate was only slightly higher as compared to 100  mm glucose concentrations, the ph dropped from 5.2 to 4.8, and only 110  mm of glucose was degraded. \\n thus, the limit of glucose seems to be ph related, because of the formation of acetate, rather than substrate inhibition. \\n the strain seems to be more tolerant for initial substrate concentrations as compared to many other thermophilic bacteria where often a concentration between 20 and 30  mm is too high for a complete degradation [ 7, 8 ]. in those cases, \\n however, more acetate was produced as compared to ethanol and may be crucial for lowering the ph at lower substrate concentrations.   it is well known that thermoanaerobacter species are highly flexible concerning end product formation depending on the culture conditions. \\n.   showed a dramatic shift in end product formation by thermoanaerobacter finnii when grown on glucose in the presence and absence of thiosulfate. in that case, both ethanol and lactate decreased during thiosulfate reduction to hydrogen sulphide, whereas the acetate concentration increased. \\n the influence of using biological hydrogen - scavenging systems has also been investigated throughout thermoanaerobacter brockii during amino acid degradation. \\n both thiosulfate and the presence of a hydrogen - scavenging methanogen were crucial for the oxidative deamination of the branched chain amino acids by this strain. however, degradation of a substrate that is thermodynamically easier to degrade, for example, the amino acid serine, was completely degraded in the presence and absence of thiosulfate and methanobacterium sp. \\n although a shift occurred between ethanol and acetate formation. to investigate the influence of low partial pressure ( ph2 ) on end product formation, strain j1 was cultivated in the presence of thiosulfate and in coculture with a hydrogenotrophic methanogen \\n as observed earlier, strain j1 produced ethanol as the main end product during glucose fermentation only ( table 1 ). \\n the addition of thiosulfate to glucose fermentations resulted in a shift towards acetate from ethanol where the ratio between ethanol and acetate changed from 6.90 to 1.29. \\n cocultivating strain j1 with a hydrogenotrophic methanogen led even to more dramatic shift towards acetate ( and methane ), and the ratio of ethanol and acetate was 0.14. \\n this difference in end product formation by using thiosulfate or a hydrogenotrophic methanogen is surprisingly big considering that the concentration of hydrogen is very low at the end of experimental time ( 0.3 to 0.5  mmoll ) in both cases. \\n this difference could be caused by more rapid uptake of hydrogen in the coculture experiment, but end products were only analysed at the end of the experimental time. the strain is producing maximally 33.9  mm ( 1.56 \\n the yields on cellulose pretreated only with enzymes and heat are 7.5  mmg dry weight ( dw ) which is considered lower as compared to glucose degradation alone ( 1.70  mol ethanol / mol glucose ; 9.4  mmg glucose ). \\n thus, the lower ethanol yields on cellulose as compared to glucose indicate that the cellulose was not completely degraded during enzymatic hydrolysis. \\n chemical pretreatment of cellulose by the addition of acid or alkali did not increase the end product formation yields on cellulose. \\n the highest ethanol yields on the more complex biomass types ( without chemical pretreatment ) were observed on hemp ( 11.6  mm ; 2.6  mmg  dw ) but lowest on straw ( 3.5  mm ; 0.8  mmg  dw ). \\n chemical pretreatment by adding either acid or alkali increased yields substantially on most of the lignocellulosic biomasses tested. \\n the increase was most profound on hydrolysates from straw pretreated with alkali where ethanol production was increased from 3.5 to 14.8  mm ( controls subtracted ). \\n the highest ethanol yields were however observed on hemp, 4.3  mmg  dw ( 19.0  mm ). \\n the highest ethanol yields by thermoanaerobacter species have been reported by continuous cultures of thermoanaerobacter strain bg1l1 on wheat straw   and corn stover, or 8.59.2  mmg sugar consumed. \\n thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus has been reported to produce 4.5 and 4.8  mm ethanolg hexose equivalent degraded from wood hydrolysate and beet molasses, respectively [ 13, 32 ]. \\n thermoanaerobacter mathranii, isolated from the same geographical area in iceland   as strain j1 produced 5.3  mmg sugar from wheat straw hydrolysate. \\n recently, a new thermoanaerobacter strain, ak5 closely related to t. thermohydrosulfuricus and t. ethanolicus, was isolated from a hot spring in iceland and has similar yields on cellulose ( 7.7  mmg ), hemp ( 3.1  mmg ), and grass ( 4.1  mmg ) hydrolysates. \\n the main aim of the study was to investigate the importance of various factors on ethanol production from both sugars and complex lignocellulosic biomass. \\n the strain produces 1.70  mol ethanol / mol glucose and 1.25  mol ethanol / mol xylose and shows a broad substrate spectrum, degrading various sugars and starch but not cellulosic substrates. \\n high ethanol yields were observed at initial glucose concentrations up to 100  mm. during growth under hydrogen removal, a shift from ethanol to \\n the strain produces up to 7.5  mm ethanolg cellulose and 4.2  mmg hemp hydrolysate.\"},\n",

thus any effect metformin has on cognitive performance may be at least partially mediated by altering serum vitamin b12 levels . \\n alternatively , patients who are prescribed metformin may have worse glycemic control or diabetes - related complications than patients with diabetes who are not prescribed metformin , so there remains the potential for confounding , despite restricting the analysis to only patients with diabetes . \\n however , because metformin is a first - line pharmacotherapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , this would seem unlikely ( 30 ) \\n . there was insufficient information regarding the duration of metformin use , the severity of diabetes ( e.g. , hba1c levels ) , duration of diabetes , or use of other antidiabetic drugs to enable us to investigate these effects in our study , particularly because these findings were based on a small sample . \\n we recommend a larger study to examine the effect of dose and duration of metformin use , and the effects of other antidiabetic agents using a battery of cognitive assessments and following participants over a number of years . \\n calcium supplements have previously been reported to reverse vitamin b12 deficiency induced by metformin . in this study , patients with diabetes who used calcium supplements were less likely to be cognitively impaired . \\n however , calcium supplements have been reported to be associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction in postmenopausal women and in patients with chronic kidney disease ( 3134 ) . \\n in contrast , a recent meta - analysis indicates that supplementation with both vitamin d and calcium is associated with a reduction in mortality compared with vitamin d supplementation alone ( 35 ) . \\n because this population already has increased cardiovascular risk ( 36 ) , the safety of calcium supplementation in patients with diabetes treated with metformin would need to be established before such interventions could be recommended . \\n patients with diabetes are at an increased risk for ad ( 10 ) . in diabetes , \\n amylin aggregation destroys the -cells of the pancreas ( 37 ) . by the same mechanism \\n metformin is a widely prescribed first - line monotherapy for type 2 diabetes but is associated with vitamin b12 deficiency and peripheral neuropathy \\n . a case - control study of more than 14,000 patients reported that long - term metformin use was associated with an increased risk for ad in those 65 years old ( 22 ) . \\n metformin at pharmacological doses was reported to increase the expression of -secretase in cell culture ; this may be a possible disease mechanism ( 21 ) . \\n alternatively , metformin also impairs absorption of vitamin b12 via a drug interaction that occurs at the distal ileum . \\n low serum vitamin b12 levels are associated with ad and other neurodegenerative diseases ( 38 ) . \\n the mmse may be inadequate for detecting differences between higher functioning adults ( 39 ) . \\n the mmse is sensitive to age , depression , and level of education , so all models were adjusted for these factors . \\n most of our subjects were assessed during routine clinical care by clinicians who use the mmse as part of their standard assessment . in australia , \\n documentation of cognitive impairment using an mmse score and improvement while receiving therapy is required to obtain subsidized antidementia therapies ( 40 ) . \\n more comprehensive assessment tools may be preferable for use in future investigations of cognitive impairment in at - risk populations such as those we have studied . \\n increased monitoring of cognitive ability in patients with diabetes who use metformin is warranted , particularly among older adults ( aged older than 50 years ) . \\n vitamin b12 supplements are inexpensive and may improve the cognitive outcomes of patients with diabetes . \\n adequately powered , prospective , controlled trials are warranted to investigate further the association between diabetes , cognitive decline , and the effect of metformin therapy , as well as the possible amelioration using vitamin b12 and/or calcium supplementation .',\n",

n = 39 ),  mildly impaired  ( mmse 1823 ; n = 40 ),  minimally impaired  ( mmse 2427 ; n = 32 ), and  not impaired  ( mmse 2830 ; n = 15 ) \\n. the effect of metformin on the cognitive performance of patients with diabetes was investigated in this model, which then was adjusted for serum vitamin b12 measurements and use of calcium supplements to investigate any possible interactions. \\n there was insufficient information on use of other antidiabetic drugs, the duration of metformin use, and markers for socioeconomic status, diet, or exercise to investigate these variables. \\n participants were 5199 years old ( mean age  sd 73.8  8.3 years ) ; females outnumbered males ( 59.5 vs. 40.5% ). \\n just more than half of the participants ( 50.4% ) scored 2830 on the mmse and so were considered not impaired ; 21.8% were minimally impaired ( mmse 2427 ), 17.7% were mildly impaired ( mmse 1823 ), and 10.1% scored less than 18 on the mmse ( most impaired ). \\n participants with diabetes were marginally older than participants without diabetes ( 75.5 vs. 73.6 years ; p = 0.013 ). \\n the number of males was proportionally larger among participants with diabetes ( 46.8 vs. 39.9% ), but this difference was not statistically significant. \\n prevalence of depression was similar between participants with diabetes and those without diabetes ( 31.7 vs. 27.3% ; p = 1.000 ). \\n the proportion of participants with a tertiary level of education was higher among participants without diabetes than participants with diabetes ( 39.3 vs. 22.2% ; p < 0.001 ). \\n the number of participants who scored below 28 on the mmse was proportionally higher among participants with diabetes than those without diabetes ( 69.0 vs. 47.6% ; p = 1.000 ). after adjusting for age, sex, education, and depression, \\n participants with type 2 diabetes had worse cognitive performance than participants without diabetes ( adjusted or 1.51 [ 95% ci 1.032.21 ] ). \\n cognitive performance was better in younger participants, those without depression, and those with a higher level of education. \\n the adjusted ors for each predictor are shown in table 1. cognitive performance in 1,354 participants who had ad or mci or were cognitively intact among participants with diabetes, cognitive performance was worse in patients who were taking metformin ( adjusted or 2.23 [ 95% ci 1.054.75 ] ). \\n mmse scores were lower in participants with diabetes who used metformin ( mean score  sd 22.8  5.5 ) than in those who did not use metformin ( 24.7  4.4 ). \\n participants with diabetes who had vitamin b12 levels < 250 mol / l also had worse cognitive performance ( 2.29 [ 1.124.66 ] ). \\n < 250 mol / l ( 22.9  4.7 ) than those with higher levels ( 25.0  4.7 ). each 1-year increase in age was associated with an 8% increased risk of impaired cognitive performance ( or 1.08 [ 95% ci 1.031.13 ] ). \\n a secondary or tertiary level of education was the strongest predictor of better cognitive performance in patients with diabetes. \\n the adjusted ors for each variable are shown in table 2. cognitive performance in 126 patients with either type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance \\n in our series, patients with diabetes who were taking metformin had worse cognitive performance than participants who were not taking metformin. \\n our observations agree with those previously reported by imfeld and colleagues ( 22 ), in particular that patients who are taking metformin may be at an increased risk for cognitive impairment. \\n this association was weakened after adjusting for serum vitamin b12 levels ; thus any effect metformin has on cognitive performance may be at least partially mediated by altering serum vitamin b12 levels. \\n alternatively, metformin also impairs absorption of vitamin b12 via a drug interaction that occurs at the distal ileum. \\n low serum vitamin b12 levels are associated with ad and other neurodegenerative diseases ( 38 ). \\n the mmse may be inadequate for detecting differences between higher functioning adults ( 39 ). \\n the mmse is sensitive to age, depression, and level of education, so all models were adjusted for these factors. \\n most of our subjects were assessed during routine clinical care by clinicians who use the mmse as part of their standard assessment. in australia, \\n documentation of cognitive impairment using an mmse score and improvement while receiving therapy is required to obtain subsidized antidementia therapies ( 40 ). \\n more comprehensive assessment tools may be preferable for use in future investigations of cognitive impairment in at - risk populations such as those we have studied. \\n increased monitoring of cognitive ability in patients with diabetes who use metformin is warranted, particularly among older adults ( aged older than 50 years ). \\n vitamin b12 supplements are inexpensive and may improve the cognitive outcomes of patients with diabetes. \\n adequately powered, prospective, controlled trials are warranted to investigate further the association between diabetes, cognitive decline, and the effect of metformin therapy, as well as the possible amelioration using vitamin b12 and/or calcium supplementation.'},\n",

       "  'input': \"the progressive aging of society is leading to an increase in the prevalence of hearing loss worldwide . \\n although hearing loss is not directly life threatening , it may impair social functioning and quality of life , causing isolation , frustration , and impaired communication [ 16 ] . \\n meanwhile , several studies have revealed that sleeping disorders such as insomnia and daytime sleepiness are associated with hearing impairments , including hearing loss and tinnitus [ 710 ] . \\n therefore , some factors associated with sleep may be associated with hearing loss . to date , however , no study has examined the putative association between hearing loss and sleep duration . in this context , we focused on subclinical objective hearing loss , which is often undetected and left untreated [ 4 , 6 ] , and investigated the lifestyles of individuals with subclinical hearing loss and the etiology of subclinical hearing loss . because frequency of 500 to 4000  hz is important range for speech processing , we determined whether hearing function at representative high ( 4000  hz ) and low ( 1000  hz ) frequencies , which are usually examined in a hearing screening test in japan [ 1113 ] , was associated with lifestyle factors , including sleep duration per night and cardiometabolic risk factors , in a cross - sectional study of japanese general population . because hearing loss has been shown to be associated with cardiometabolic risk factors , such as diabetes and smoking [ 1116 ] , we considered these factors as relevant confounding factors and also examined the associations between hearing loss and these cardiometabolic risk factors . to examine the effects of subclinical hearing loss on the incidence of longer sleep duration ( 8  h and 9  h ) , we performed a retrospective 8-year longitudinal study in an independent group of subjects \\n whose sleep duration was classified as normal or short ( 7  h ) at baseline . \\n this study was based on a composite research program that is being conducted to identify the factors associated with cardiometabolic and atherosclerotic diseases . \\n this retrospective study consists of data recorded during annual medical checkups of asymptomatic individuals living or working in saitama prefecture , a suburb of tokyo , japan . the study started in 2011 and involves the collaboration of three institutions in saitama : jichi medical university , josai university , and saitama health promotion corporation . \\n the protocol , which conforms to the declaration of helsinki , was approved by the ethics committee of jichi medical university and josai university and by the committee of the saitama health promotion corporation . written informed consent was obtained from all participants . since 1997 \\n , saitama health promotion corporation , a public interest corporation , has supported the health of individuals , including children and adolescents , living or working in saitama prefecture , primarily by carrying out various types of medical checkups . \\n we digitally stored data from 83 286 apparently healthy subjects aged 2079 years old who underwent medical checkups at saitama health promotion corporation between april 1 , 2007 , and march 31 , 2008 . \\n subjects with diagnosed or undiagnosed self - reported hearing loss ( n = 488 ) were excluded from the analysis because the cause and treatment received ( e.g. , hearing aids and pharmacotherapy ) were not available in this study . \\n subjects with self - reported depression and sleep apnea syndrome were also excluded because these conditions may affect sleep duration [ 1922 ] . \\n the exclusion criteria applied in this study and the disposition of subjects are shown in figure 1 . \\n subjects with self - reported tinnitus ( n = 1 , 396 ) were included because tinnitus was usually mild and was not always diagnosed by a physician in this study . \\n consequently , 48 091 subjects were included in the cross - sectional study . when we selected subjects for the longitudinal study from those included in the cross - sectional study , the number of subjects whose baseline sleep duration was normal or short ( 7  h ) and who underwent the same checkup four times between april 1 , 1999 , and march 31 , 2008 ( 8 years duration ) , was < 1,000 . \\n therefore , subjects included in the longitudinal study were identified from the original study population , which means the subjects included in the longitudinal study differed from those included in the cross - sectional study . \\n however , the assessment of hearing loss and other laboratory tests were identical between the cross - sectional and longitudinal studies . \\n after excluding subjects with incomplete data and those with known ear diseases , 6,774 subjects with normal or short sleep duration at baseline were included in the longitudinal study ( figure 1 ) . during 8 years \\n , many subjects abandoned the medical checkup held by saitama health promotion corporation ( average proportions of not undergoing the same checkup next year was approximately one - fourth to one - third during 1999~2008 ) and changed to other checkups because of house moving , resignation , or change of jobs , child care , or family reasons , resulting in the decreased number of subjects in the longitudinal study . \\n serum parameters were measured using standard methods on hitachi autoanalyzers ( tokyo , japan ) at saitama health promotion corporation . \\n hemoglobin ( hb ) a1c was converted to national glycohemoglobin standardization program levels using a validated formula . \\n the hearing test was conducted in a quiet room by trained staff using an ordinary audiometer . \\n subclinical ( objective ) hearing loss was defined as a pure - tone average hearing loss of > 25  db at high ( 4000  hz ) and low ( 1000  hz ) frequencies . \\n self - reported sleep duration per night , which was obtained as a response to the simple question about sleep , was divided into five categories ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9  h ) according to previous studies [ 24 , 25 ] . \\n subjects completed a form to record history of cardiovascular disease ( including stroke ) , complications ( hypertension , diabetes , or dyslipidemia ) , alcohol consumption ( no , occasional , 13 times / week , 46 times / week , or daily ) , smoking status ( no , past , or current ) , regular exercise ( 30  min per time ; no , occasional , once / week , or at least twice / week ) , and work duration ( 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , or 11  h ) . the influence of body weight was evaluated in terms of body mass index ( bmi ) , which was divided into six categories ( 18.9 , 19.020.9 , 21.022.9 , 23.024.9 , 25.026.9 , and 27.0 \\n we took into consideration that who has proposed that bmi cutoff points for overweight and obesity for asian populations should be lower ( 23.0  kg / m and 27.5  kg / m , resp . ) compared to western populations . since the proportions of subjects classified as underweight ( i.e. , < 18.5  kg / m ) or obese ( i.e. , 30.0  kg / m ) are very low ( 4.8% and 5.0% , resp . ) in this study , we round up the low and high bmi cutoffs to 19 and 27  kg / m ( 7.4% and 15.1% , resp . ) \\n the influence of systemic inflammation was roughly evaluated in terms of the circulating white blood cell count , a putative risk factor for cardiovascular disease [ 2729 ] , which was divided into quartiles . because organic solvents can affect sleep duration [ 30 , 31 ] , the use of organic solvent in the workplace was taken into account , although the type was not recorded and the number of subjects was limited ( n = 39 , 691 ) . \\n differences in clinical parameters and categorical variables between the five categories of sleep duration were examined by one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) and  tests , respectively . \\n the prevalence of hearing loss was first evaluated in four age groups ( 2039 , 4049 , 5051 , and 6079 years ) because advancing age is one of the main risk factors for hearing loss . in the cross - sectional study , \\n multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine whether subclinical hearing loss was associated with lifestyle and cardiometabolic risk factors to calculate odds ratios ( or ) and 95% confidence intervals ( ci ) with adjustment for relevant confounders . after sleep durations in five categories of sleep duration \\n were coded as 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 for 5  h , 6  h , 7  h , 8  h , and 9  h , respectively , associations between sleep duration as a continuous variable and hearing loss were examined . the associations between relevant confounders and hearing loss were also evaluated . for the longitudinal analysis , \\n multivariate logistic regression models were also used to examine the association between baseline hearing loss and risk of longer sleep duration ( 8  h and 9  h ) after 9 years to calculate relative risk ( rr ) and 95% confidence interval ( ci ) because the incidence of longer sleep duration after 9 years was < 10% and the ors are expressed as relative risks in the longitudinal study . in this analysis \\n , the provisional reference bmi categories were defined as a bmi of 21.022.9  kg / m based on the proposal by the world health organization regarding overweight and obese classifications for asian populations . \\n statistical analyses were performed using ibm - spss version 18.0 ( pasw statistics 18 ; chicago , il , usa ) and statview version 5.0 ( sas institute ; cary , nc , usa ) . values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant . \\n the clinical characteristics of the subjects are presented in table 1 . subjects with longer sleep duration were more frequently men , were older , and had a shorter work duration , with increased numbers of cardiometabolic risk factors ( especially decreased high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ) . \\n bmi , white blood cell count , and the frequency of current smokers , no regular exercise , or use of organic solvents at work showed u- or j - shaped relationships with sleep duration . \\n the prevalence of cardiovascular disease , hypertension , and diabetes increased with increasing sleep duration . \\n similarly , the prevalence of hearing loss increased with increasing sleep duration , irrespective of the left or right ear , or frequency . \\n the proportions of manufacturing and construction workers were higher in the longer sleep duration groups ( 8  h and 9  h ) , whereas the opposite was true for the proportions of clerical , technical , and medical workers . \\n the prevalence of hearing loss at 4000  hz increased significantly with increasing sleep duration in any age strata except for younger age ( 2039 years old ) . \\n likewise , the prevalence of hearing loss at 1000  hz increased significantly with increasing sleep duration , particularly in the older age groups . however , there seemed to be a slight j - shaped relationship in subjects aged 6079 years . \\n multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that , compared with sleep duration of 5  h , the other categories of sleep duration were significantly associated with hearing loss at 4000 and 1000  hz at least in one ear ( table 2 ) . \\n adjustment for confounding factors , including age and sex , markedly attenuated the associations , but changing the reference sleep duration category from 5  h to 6  h ( model 2b ) or additional adjustment for the use of organic solvents at work ( model 3 ) did not . \\n likewise , sleep duration as a continuous variable was also significantly associated with hearing loss at 4000 and 1000  hz . \\n table 3 shows the ors for the confounding factors , except age , for hearing loss . \\n male sex , diabetes , no regular exercise , and tinnitus were significantly associated with hearing loss at both frequencies , whereas regular alcohol consumption , but not daily alcohol consumption , was inversely associated with hearing loss . \\n low body weight , the highest quartile of white blood cell count ( 88.9 10/l ) , current smoking , and daily alcohol consumption were significantly associated with hearing loss at 4000  hz . \\n work duration was significantly and inversely associated with hearing loss at 1000  hz but not at 4000  hz . compared with clerical work , other work types , except managerial and medical work , \\n were significantly associated with hearing loss at 4000  hz ( ors 1.244.49 ) and 1000  hz ( ors 1.341.90 ) , even after controlling for confounding factors , including work duration ( data not shown ) . \\n the baseline clinical characteristics of subjects included in the longitudinal study ( table 4 ) are similar to those of the subjects included in the cross - sectional study ( table 1 ) . \\n table 5 shows rrs of hearing loss at baseline for the longer sleep duration ( 8  hr ) after 9 years . \\n the risk of long sleep duration was significantly greater in subjects with hearing loss at 4000  hz at baseline compared with subjects without such hearing loss . \\n although subjects with hearing loss at 1000  hz at baseline had a significantly higher risk for longer sleep duration , this disappeared after adjusting for fundamental confounding factors ( model 2 ) . \\n our cross - sectional and longitudinal studies provide robust evidence that subclinical hearing loss , especially at high frequencies , is associated with longer sleep duration , which was particularly depicted in older age , independently of relevant lifestyle factors , cardiometabolic risk factors , and the use of organic solvents at work . \\n these associations were not weakened when the reference sleep duration was changed to 6  h , the major sleep duration category in this study . \\n although several epidemiological studies have shown u- or j - shaped relationships between sleep duration and clinical disorders , such as obesity and diabetes [ 24 , 33 , 34 ] , the relationship between hearing loss at 4000  hz and sleep duration in our study was nearly linear in all of the age categories . \\n because many studies have shown that noise - induced hearing loss , a major form of acquired hearing loss , gradually begins around the frequency of 4000  hz [ 36 , 37 ] , currently observed hearing loss might be attributable to a great extent to the long - term noise exposure , which was not measured in this study . regarding the cause - effect relationship , considering the results of our longitudinal study , it is likely that longer sleep duration may occur because of or in conjunction with hearing loss . in other words , subclinical hearing loss may be a predictor of long sleep duration , which may be related to the development of cardiometabolic disease [ 24 , 3338 ] . \\n hearing loss is also associated with dementia and cognitive impairment [ 3942 ] , whereas cognitive impairments , including alzheimer disease , are associated with sleep and circadian problems [ 4345 ] . \\n therefore , it is possible that long sleep duration might reflect other clinical conditions that were not examined in this study and that the currently observed associations may be spurious and unknown factors might mediate two conditions . \\n frustration and uneasiness associated with hearing loss or noisy daytime environments may reduce sleep quality and provoke insomnia [ 9 , 10 , 46 ] and may result in longer sleep durations . \\n by contrast , once individuals with hearing loss do fall asleep , they could maintain good sleep without waking during the night . \\n hearing loss might also protect sleep by reducing the subjects ' awareness of environmental noise during sleep   and might prolong sleep duration [ 4648 ] . \\n meanwhile , many previous studies have provided evidence that diabetes , cardiometabolic disease , and smoking are associated with hearing loss [ 1116 ] , plausibly through diabetic micro- and macroangiopathy [ 14 , 49 , 50 ] . \\n thus , like typical diabetic complications , hearing loss may be one of complications following diabetic or atherosclerotic etiologies . \\n nevertheless , there is also a possibility that long - time sleep in turn may deteriorate the pathophysiology of diabetes and atherosclerosis because of putative associations between long - time sleep and diabetes [ 24 , 3338 ] . \\n intriguingly , low bmi ( i.e. , low body weight rather than obesity ) was associated with hearing loss at 4000  hz . \\n underweight might be associated with increased risk for hearing loss through inadequate intake of dietary nutrients , especially vitamin b12 and antioxidants [ 5155 ] , or other factors that were previously reported to be associated with increased mortality in underweight people [ 5658 ] . in our study , \\n hearing loss at 4000  hz was also associated with current smoking , daily alcohol consumption , and high white blood cell count , which are all generally classified as cardiovascular risk factors [ 2729 , 5962 ] . recently , \\n ronksley et al .   have shown that neutrophil - lymphocyte ratio , white blood cell count , and c - reactive protein may be associated with hearing loss of diabetic patients . taken together , although noise - induced hearing loss commonly begins at frequency of 4000  hz [ 3537 ] , our results demonstrates that some cardiovascular risk factors might aggravate the pathophysiology of such noise - induced hearing loss . \\n then , long - term noise exposure and cardiovascular risk factors might provoke and aggravate a pivotal health damage of hearing loss and sequentially sleep disorder , which needs to be confirmed in further study . \\n first , we assessed self - reported sleep duration but not the quality of sleep or other related factors . \\n nocturnal awakening , insomnia , nocturia , daytime napping , and difficulties with falling sleep may interfere with the observed associations [ 8 , 63 , 64 ] . \\n future studies should also include objective assessments of sleep duration , preferably made using actigraphy , because such factors may be important confounding factors . \\n second , we did not assess socioeconomic status in terms of education or annual income . \\n it is possible that the site of residence , work duration , or shift work could shift the endogenous sleeping duration to an exogenously restricted sleeping duration [ 41 , 6567 ] . \\n however , adjustment for the type or duration of work did not markedly alter the associations . \\n other screening methods , such as whispered voice , finger rubbing , and watch tick tests , can detect subclinical hearing loss that may not be identified with audiometric tests [ 6 , 68 ] . \\n finally , our results may not be applicable to other populations who have different sleep durations , socioeconomic status , morbidities , and longevities , because these are likely to affect both sleep duration and subclinical hearing loss . \\n our results suggest that subclinical hearing loss , especially at a high frequency , was independently associated with longer sleep duration and cardiometabolic risk factors in japanese general population .\",\n",

old female mkr and wild - type mice chronically with cl-316243 ( 1 mg  kg body wt  day ) or vehicle for 3 weeks . \\n female mkr mice exhibit reduced body weight and body adiposity compared with wild - type mice ( 5 ) . \\n as observed in our previous study in male wild - type and mkr mice ( 30 ) , we found that cl-316243 treatment did not affect body weight ( fig . \\n additionally , we found that after 1 week of cl-316243 treatment , the moderately elevated blood glucose levels ( 20% ) in mkr mice were significantly lowered ( fig . \\n importantly , we show that female mkr mice display severely elevated plasma insulin levels , which were significantly reduced upon cl-316243 treatment , whereas no effect of the drug on insulin levels was seen in wild -

type and mkr mice . \\n this allows us to study the effect of insulin reduction on mammary tumor progression in mkr mice . to investigate the effect of insulin - sensitizing therapy on early stages of mammary tumor development , we used a pyvmt - induced transgenic tumor model ( 27 ) . \\n pyvmt transgenic mice express the pyvmt oncogene exclusively in the mammary epithelium under the control of the mmtv promoter . \\n pyvmt - induced mammary tumors recapitulate many morphologic and pathophysiological processes found in human breast cancer , and their development begins with the formation of a single hyperplastic focus in the lateral part of the mammary gland at 34 weeks of age ( 38 ) . \\n to assess the effect of antidiabetic therapy on mammary tumor development , we treated pyvmt / mkr and pyvmt mice with cl-316243 ( 1 mg  kg body wt  day ) or vehicle from 3 to 6 weeks of age . \\n the metabolic effects of cl-316243 treatment were similar to those observed in adult mice ( supplementary fig . \\n whole - mount analyses of vehicle - treated pyvmt / mkr mice revealed a larger area of hyperplastic mammary lesions ( increase of 57% ) compared with the pyvmt mice ( fig . \\n 3a and b ) due to accelerated formation of hyperplasia in a hyperinsulinemic milieu . in contrast , pharmacological correction of hyperinsulinemia in pyvmt / mkr mice resulted in a tumor phenotype similar to nondiabetic pyvmt mice ( fig . \\n note that the cl-316243treated nondiabetic pyvmt mice show no changes in mammary transformation . to determine whether the attenuation in tumor progression in the cl-316243treated mice resulted from an inhibition of insulin signaling , we analyzed the phosphorylation of the ir / igf - ir in the hyperplastic mammary tissue of vehicle - and cl-316243treated mice ( fig . \\n 3 ) . we found that hyperinsulinemia led to an increased activation of the ir / igf - ir in transformed mammary tissue of pyvmt / mkr mice , whereas pharmacological correction of insulin levels by cl-316243 treatment significantly reduced this effect . \\n taken together , we demonstrate that lowering insulin levels in type 2 diabetic pyvmt / mkr mice reduces ir / igf - ir activation and abrogates the accelerated formation of hyperplastic mammary lesions . \\n treatment with cl-316243 prevents the accelerated formation of hyperplastic mammary lesions in diabetic mice and attenuates ir / igf -

transformed mammary tumor cells ( met-1 cells ) orthotopically into the no . \\n 4 mammary fat pad ( 0.5  10 cells ) of 8-week - old female mkr or wild - type mice . \\n starting 7 days after tumor cell inoculation , when tumors were palpable , the animals were treated with cl-316243 ( 1 mg  kg body wt  day ) for 3 weeks . as shown in fig . \\n 4a , tumor volume increased in vehicle - treated mkr mice , whereas mkr mice treated with cl-316243 displayed a significant reduction in tumor growth and were similar in size to wild - type controls . \\n importantly , cl-316243 treatment had no effect on tumor growth in the wild - type mice . \\n these findings were confirmed by measuring wet tumor weight at the end of the study ( fig . \\n 4b ) . treatment with cl-316243 reverses the accelerated growth of advanced pyvmt - induced mammary tumors . \\n 4 mammary fat pad of 8-week -

sensitizing drug cl-316243 , a highly selective 3-ar agonist , reverses diabetes - induced mammary tumor progression in hyperinsulinemic , type 2 diabetic mkr mice . \\n our findings corroborate a major role of insulin in type 2 diabetes  mediated mammary tumor progression , which is in concert with our previous findings ( 5 ) . \\n high concentrations of insulin are known to activate the igf - ir ( 40 ) and our previous findings demonstrate that the ir , and to lesser extent the igf - ir , are activated in hyperplastic mammary tumor tissue extracted from type 2 diabetic mice ( 5 ) . moreover , pharmacological blockade of the ir / igf - ir using bms-536924 , a small - molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor , led to abrogation of diabetes - induced mammary tumor progression in mkr mice ; however , it also worsened insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia ( 5 ) . here \\n we demonstrate that insulin - sensitizing treatment has a comparable effect on tumor progression but simultaneously exerts antidiabetic activity . \\n our results imply that elevated insulin levels should be targeted pharmacologically at early stages of the disease to lower breast cancer risk and progression in patients with type 2 diabetes . \\n the effect of antidiabetic medications on cancer development is poorly understood and no prior experimental studies have thoroughly investigated whether pharmacological reduction of insulin levels reduces mammary tumor growth in a type 2 diabetic organism . \\n the reason for this is that the most widely used insulin - sensitizing drugs ( metformin and tzds ) are known to exert direct , predominantly antineoplastic , effects on cancer cells , both in vitro and in vivo in nondiabetic animals ( 1517,1923,41 ) . \\n thus , we decided to use cl-316243 , a highly selective 3-ar agonist with no known direct effect on mammary tumors , to study the consequence of lowering insulin levels on diabetes - mediated mammary tumor progression . \\n however , it should be noted that 3-ar agonists ( unlike metformin and tzds ) have not yet been developed for clinical use in humans due to various problems including a lack of selectivity and poor pharmacokinetics ( 42 ) . \\n ( 18 ) have reported that metformin attenuates the effect of high - energy diet  induced insulin resistance on growth of lewis lung llc1 carcinoma cells . \\n both , the insulin - sensitizing action as well as the direct antineoplastic activity of metformin may be involved in this finding . however , in the setting of excess energy intake and obesity , other factors besides hyperinsulinemia can promote tumor growth , such as adipokines , proinflammatory cytokines , adipose tissue  derived sex steroids , or altered levels of circulating carbohydrates and lipids ( 43 ) , some of which may be affected by metformin treatment ( 44,45 ) . \\n thus , as an experimental model for insulin resistance independent of obesity , we used a lean , hyperinsulinemic mouse model of type 2 diabetes , the female mkr mice . \\n these mice develop severe insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia but have only mild dysglycemia and thus recapitulate the early stages of type 2 diabetes . as these mice display reduced body adiposity and show no increase in serum ffas , leptin , or the proinflammatory cytokines tnf- or il-6 and only a moderate elevation in serum triglycerides , they serve as an ideal model to study mammary tumor progression uncoupled from obesity - related tumor - promoting factors . \\n apart from reducing insulin levels , chronic treatment with cl-316243 also decreases blood glucose levels in mkr mice . \\n hyperglycemia has been proposed to promote tumor growth through the increased flux of glucose , which fuels tumor cells ( 46 ) . \\n however , a major pathophysiological role of elevated blood glucose levels in the tumor - promoting action of type 2 diabetes in mkr mice is unlikely because of the following : 1 ) female mkr mice display only mild dysglycemia ( 20% increase in blood glucose levels compared with wild - type mice ) , 2 ) in animals with type 1 diabetes , which are insulin deficient because of immune destruction of the pancreatic -cells , tumors regress despite severe hyperglycemia ( 47,48 ) , 3 ) although some epidemiologic studies show a correlation between elevated blood glucose levels and cancer risk , the studies may be confounded by preexisting hyperinsulinemia ( 49 ) . \\n chronic cl-316243 treatment reduces serum ffa , triglyceride , and leptin levels in both mkr and wild - type mice . as this decrease \\n is observed in both genotypes and the antineoplastic effect of cl-316243 is specific to mkr mice , these factors are most likely not major players in the tumor - reducing effect of cl-316243 . \\n nevertheless , we can not fully exclude that changes in lipid or leptin levels may , at least in part , have an impact on breast tumor progression in mkr mice . \\n taken together , our experimental approach allowed us to test the effect of insulin - sensitizing therapy on tumor progression in a setting in which obesity - associated confounding factors are minimal . \\n our findings demonstrate that hyperinsulinemia in mice with type 2 diabetes significantly increases ir / igf - ir activation in transformed mammary tissue , whereas pharmacological reduction of insulin levels attenuates this effect . \\n law et al.(50 ) reported that phosphorylation of the ir / igf - ir was present in nearly 50% of all analyzed human primary breast tumors and was predictive for a poor outcome . \\n however , the authors did not obtain information on the insulin levels in the patients studied . \\n it remains to be evaluated whether the extent of ir / igf - ir activation in breast cancer specimen correlates with underlying type 2 diabetes and hyperinsulinemia in breast cancer patients . \\n if this is the case , then insulin lowering therapy could reduce breast cancer risk and mortality . in conclusion , we demonstrate that the administration of insulin - sensitizing therapy using a 3-ar agonist abrogates the accelerated mammary tumor progression in a nonobese mouse model of type 2 diabetes . this effect is accompanied by a reduction of insulin levels leading to a decrease in the phosphorylation of the ir / igf - ir in transformed mammary tissue . \\n these results demonstrate that insulin - lowering therapy is an important modifier of breast cancer progression . \\n our findings thus provide a rationale for early administration of insulin - sensitizing therapy in patients with hyperinsulinemia and/or type 2 diabetes , as such treatment may have a significant impact on breast cancer risk , morbidity , and mortality .\",\n",

old female mkr and wild - type mice chronically with cl-316243 ( 1 mg  kg body wt  day ) or vehicle for 3 weeks. \\n female mkr mice exhibit reduced body weight and body adiposity compared with wild -

type mice ( wild type, vehicle : 0.42  0.01 vs. wild type, cl-316243 : 0.43  0.02 ; mkr, vehicle : 13.12  3.74 vs. mkr, cl-316243 : 3.28  0.85 ng / ml ) ( fig. \\n mkr and wild - type ( wt ) mice were treated with cl-316243 ( cl,  ) or vehicle ( v,  ) from 9 to 12 weeks of age. body weight ( a ) and food intake ( b ) were measured twice a week. \\n body adiposity ( c ) was measured 10 days after the onset of treatment in nonanesthetized mice using an echomri 3-in-1 nmr system ; glucose ( d ) and insulin ( e ) levels were measured in whole blood and plasma, respectively, 1 week after initiation of treatment in the nonfasting state. \\n p  0.05 for cl-316243 vs. vehicle group ; # p  0.05 for wild -

type and mkr mice. \\n this allows us to study the effect of insulin reduction on mammary tumor progression in mkr mice. \\n to investigate the effect of insulin - sensitizing therapy on early stages of mammary tumor development, we used a pyvmt - induced transgenic tumor model ( 27 ). \\n pyvmt transgenic mice express the pyvmt oncogene exclusively in the mammary epithelium under the control of the mmtv promoter. \\n pyvmt - induced mammary tumors recapitulate many morphologic and pathophysiological processes found in human breast cancer, and their development begins with the formation of a single hyperplastic focus in the lateral part of the mammary gland at 34 weeks of age ( 38 ). \\n to assess the effect of antidiabetic therapy on mammary tumor development, we treated pyvmt / mkr and pyvmt mice with cl-316243 ( 1 mg  kg body wt  day ) or vehicle from 3 to 6 weeks of age. \\n the metabolic effects of cl-316243 treatment were similar to those observed in adult mice ( supplementary fig. \\n whole - mount analyses of vehicle - treated pyvmt / mkr mice revealed a larger area of hyperplastic mammary lesions ( increase of 57% ) compared with the pyvmt mice ( fig. \\n 3a and b ) due to accelerated formation of hyperplasia in a hyperinsulinemic milieu. in contrast, pharmacological correction of hyperinsulinemia in pyvmt / mkr mice resulted in a tumor phenotype similar to nondiabetic pyvmt mice ( fig. \\n note that the cl-316243treated nondiabetic pyvmt mice show no changes in mammary transformation. to determine whether the attenuation in tumor progression in the cl-316243treated mice resulted from an inhibition of insulin signaling, we analyzed the phosphorylation of the ir / igf - ir in the hyperplastic mammary tissue of vehicle - and cl-316243treated mice ( fig. \\n 3 ). we found that hyperinsulinemia led to an increased activation of the ir / igf - ir in transformed mammary tissue of pyvmt / mkr mice, whereas pharmacological correction of insulin levels by cl-316243 treatment significantly reduced this effect. \\n taken together, we demonstrate that lowering insulin levels in type 2 diabetic pyvmt / mkr mice reduces ir / igf -

type mice. \\n these findings were confirmed by measuring wet tumor weight at the end of the study ( fig. \\n 4b ). treatment with cl-316243 reverses the accelerated growth of advanced pyvmt - induced mammary tumors. \\n 4 mammary fat pad of 8-week -

sensitizing drug cl-316243, a highly selective 3-ar agonist, reverses diabetes - induced mammary tumor progression in hyperinsulinemic, type 2 diabetic mkr mice. \\n our findings corroborate a major role of insulin in type 2 diabetes  mediated mammary tumor progression, which is in concert with our previous findings ( 5 ). \\n high concentrations of insulin are known to activate the igf - ir ( 40 ) and our previous findings demonstrate that the ir, and to lesser extent the igf - ir, are activated in hyperplastic mammary tumor tissue extracted from type 2 diabetic mice ( 5 ). moreover, pharmacological blockade of the ir / igf - ir using bms-536924, a small - molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, led to abrogation of diabetes - induced mammary tumor progression in mkr mice ; however, it also worsened insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia ( 5 ). here \\n we demonstrate that insulin - sensitizing treatment has a comparable effect on tumor progression but simultaneously exerts antidiabetic activity. \\n our results imply that elevated insulin levels should be targeted pharmacologically at early stages of the disease to lower breast cancer risk and progression in patients with type 2 diabetes. \\n the effect of antidiabetic medications on cancer development is poorly understood and no prior experimental studies have thoroughly investigated whether pharmacological reduction of insulin levels reduces mammary tumor growth in a type 2 diabetic organism. \\n the reason for this is that the most widely used insulin - sensitizing drugs ( metformin and tzds ) are known to exert direct, predominantly antineoplastic, effects on cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo in nondiabetic animals ( 1517,1923,41 ). \\n thus, we decided to use cl-316243, a highly selective 3-ar agonist with no known direct effect on mammary tumors, to study the consequence of lowering insulin levels on diabetes - mediated mammary tumor progression. \\n however, it should be noted that 3-ar agonists ( unlike metformin and tzds ) have not yet been developed for clinical use in humans due to various problems including a lack of selectivity and poor pharmacokinetics ( 42 ). \\n ( 18 ) have reported that metformin attenuates the effect of high - energy diet  induced insulin resistance on growth of lewis lung llc1 carcinoma cells. \\n both, the insulin - sensitizing action as well as the direct antineoplastic activity of metformin may be involved in this finding. however, in the setting of excess energy intake and obesity, other factors besides hyperinsulinemia can promote tumor growth, such as adipokines, proinflammatory cytokines, adipose tissue  derived sex steroids, or altered levels of circulating carbohydrates and lipids ( 43 ), some of which may be affected by metformin treatment ( 44,45 ). \\n thus, as an experimental model for insulin resistance independent of obesity, we used a lean, hyperinsulinemic mouse model of type 2 diabetes, the female mkr mice. \\n these mice develop severe insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia but have only mild dysglycemia and thus recapitulate the early stages of type 2 diabetes. as these mice display reduced body adiposity and show no increase in serum ffas, leptin, or the proinflammatory cytokines tnf- or il-6 and only a moderate elevation in serum triglycerides, they serve as an ideal model to study mammary tumor progression uncoupled from obesity - related tumor - promoting factors. \\n apart from reducing insulin levels, chronic treatment with cl-316243 also decreases blood glucose levels in mkr mice. \\n hyperglycemia has been proposed to promote tumor growth through the increased flux of glucose, which fuels tumor cells ( 46 ). \\n however, a major pathophysiological role of elevated blood glucose levels in the tumor - promoting action of type 2 diabetes in mkr mice is unlikely because of the following : 1 ) female mkr mice display only mild dysglycemia ( 20% increase in blood glucose levels compared with wild - type mice ), 2 ) in animals with type 1 diabetes, which are insulin deficient because of immune destruction of the pancreatic -cells, tumors regress despite severe hyperglycemia ( 47,48 ), 3 ) although some epidemiologic studies show a correlation between elevated blood glucose levels and cancer risk, the studies may be confounded by preexisting hyperinsulinemia ( 49 ). \\n chronic cl-316243 treatment reduces serum ffa, triglyceride, and leptin levels in both mkr and wild - type mice. as this decrease \\n is observed in both genotypes and the antineoplastic effect of cl-316243 is specific to mkr mice, these factors are most likely not major players in the tumor - reducing effect of cl-316243. \\n nevertheless, we can not fully exclude that changes in lipid or leptin levels may, at least in part, have an impact on breast tumor progression in mkr mice. \\n taken together, our experimental approach allowed us to test the effect of insulin - sensitizing therapy on tumor progression in a setting in which obesity - associated confounding factors are minimal. \\n our findings demonstrate that hyperinsulinemia in mice with type 2 diabetes significantly increases ir / igf - ir activation in transformed mammary tissue, whereas pharmacological reduction of insulin levels attenuates this effect. \\n law et al.(50 ) reported that phosphorylation of the ir / igf - ir was present in nearly 50% of all analyzed human primary breast tumors and was predictive for a poor outcome. \\n however, the authors did not obtain information on the insulin levels in the patients studied. \\n it remains to be evaluated whether the extent of ir / igf - ir activation in breast cancer specimen correlates with underlying type 2 diabetes and hyperinsulinemia in breast cancer patients. \\n if this is the case, then insulin lowering therapy could reduce breast cancer risk and mortality. in conclusion, we demonstrate that the administration of insulin - sensitizing therapy using a 3-ar agonist abrogates the accelerated mammary tumor progression in a nonobese mouse model of type 2 diabetes. this effect is accompanied by a reduction of insulin levels leading to a decrease in the phosphorylation of the ir / igf - ir in transformed mammary tissue. \\n these results demonstrate that insulin - lowering therapy is an important modifier of breast cancer progression. \\n our findings thus provide a rationale for early administration of insulin - sensitizing therapy in patients with hyperinsulinemia and/or type 2 diabetes, as such treatment may have a significant impact on breast cancer risk, morbidity, and mortality.\"},\n",

       "  'input': 'annually , falls occur in about one third of community - dwelling adults aged 65 and older living in the us.1 the physical and functional impacts ( fractures , soft - tissue injury , premature institutionalization , and deaths ) of falls have been well documented , but little is known about the long - term emotional and cognitive impact of falls.26 also , falls , depression , and cognitive impairments frequently coexist in the same patient , raising the possibility of shared risk factors and shared etiology . preventing falls - related \\n disability requires a good understanding of how experience of falls affects subsequent emotional and cognitive function . \\n such understanding can inform development of interventions to stem the onset of not only physical disability but any fall - related cognitive disability . \\n falls , depression , and cognitive impairment shared common risk factors.3,5,712 past studies showed a relationship between cognitive impairment and falls,3,8,9 cognitive impairment and depression,10 and falls and depression.6,11,12 however , the synergistic relationship among these three syndromes has not been explored in depth . \\n raji et al found an association between lower scores on the mini mental state examination ( mmse ) and high depressive symptomatology in older mexican americans.10 a later study of the effects of cognitive and emotional status on physical functioning found that having high depression and low cognition was associated with poor physical performance.13 in another study of 283 adults aged 60 and older , biderman et al determined that the common risk factors for falls and depression are poor self - rated health , poor cognitive status , impaired ability to perform activities of daily living , two or more clinic visits in the past month , and slow walking speed.14 another explanation for the complex relationships among falls , depression , and cognitive decline may be due to subsequent events following development of one of the conditions . \\n . falls in older persons have been associated with development of fear of falls,15 with a subsequent decrease in levels of physical activity , walking , participation in social activities , and an increase in loneliness and social isolation.1519 over time , reduced social and physical activity may lead to onset of depression and future cognitive decline.2022 we wanted to explore this hypothesis further by testing whether , in a group of cognitively intact elders , recurrent falls would be independently associated with faster cognitive decline , and whether presence of depression would at least in part mediate this association . because of the high prevalence of depressive symptoms and cognitive impairments in older mexican american adults,11,23,24 a fast growing segment of the us population , we wanted to test whether having a fall would trigger social isolation , depression , and subsequent worsening of cognition . to avoid the floor effects of the mmse \\n , we chose to include only those with normal baseline cognition ( mmse 21 ) , a cut - off point recommended in populations with low educational attainment.25 mean education of our sample was 6.3 years . understanding the fall - cognition pathway is key to designing interventions that address all the potential pathways to cognitive and motor \\n first , we examined the association of falls versus no falls on subsequent change in cognitive function ( using the mmse ) over a 6-year period in a community sample of older mexican americans who were initially cognitively normal . \\n second , because past research has shown an association between depression and cognitive decline,10 we tested whether depressive symptoms would have a mediating effect on the association between falls and cognitive change . \\n data are from the h -

square , analysis of variance , and post hoc tukey s tests were used to examine the distribution of covariates for participants by fall status at baseline . \\n general linear mixed models using the mixed procedure in sas ( sas institute , inc . \\n , cary , nc , usa ) were used to examine the factors associated with decline in cognitive function over a 6-year period as a function of fall status . \\n all variables were analyzed as time - dependent covariates ( potential to change as time progresses ) except age , sex , and education . \\n the mixed model was chosen for analysis because it best handles unbalanced data , allowing for modeling of both the time - dependent change in variables as well as the time - dependent change in the magnitude of association between variables . \\n in addition , because h - epese data comprised repeated measures over 6 years , mixed models allowed more flexibility in modeling the effects of time on outcome.31,32 three mixed models were constructed to test the relationship between fall status and cognitive decline over a 6-year period . model 1 included time , age , sex , marital status , years of formal education , and fall status . in model 2 , depressive symptomatology was added to the variables in model 1 . \\n medical conditions ( stroke , heart attack , hypertension , and diabetes ) were added to variables in model 3 . \\n models 2 and 3 were performed to test whether high depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between falls and cognitive decline ( model 2 ) and to test whether the relationship between falls and cognitive decline remains statistically significant after adjusting for all covariates ( model 3 ) . \\n all analyses were performed using the sas system for windows , version 9.2 ( sas institute , inc . ) . \\n at baseline , the mean age for the 1,119 participants was 80.8 years ( range , 74109 ) . sixty percent of the participants were female , 45.6% were married , and the mean years - of - education was 6.3 years ( range , 017 ) . \\n sixty five percent of participants reported hypertension , 32.9% diabetes , 14.9% heart attack , 10.7% stroke , 5.6% hip fracture , and 11.9% had high depressive symptoms at baseline . \\n the prevalence of participants who fell once was 16.6% and was 14.7% for those who fell two or more times . \\n the mean mmse score was 25.53.1 for no falls , 24.93.0 for one fall , and 24.52.9 for two or more falls . \\n the difference was statistically significant between those who fell two or more times and those who did not fall ( p<0.05 ) . \\n participants who fell two or more times were significantly more likely to be older , female , and to report higher levels of depressive symptoms , hypertension , diabetes , heart attack , and stroke compared to those with one fall or no falls . \\n no statistically significant association was seen with hip fracture . those who fell two or more times had lower performance in handgrip strength when compared with those with no falls ( p<0.05 ) . \\n table 2 shows the general linear mixed model estimates for mmse score as a function of fall over a 6-year period \\n . the adjusted rate of decline in the total mmse score was 0.25 points per year ( model 1 ) . \\n participants who fell two or more times had a greater decline in mmse score of 0.81 points per year ( p<0.0001 ) compared with those who did not fall , after adjusting for age , sex , marital status , and education ( model 1 ) . \\n participants who fell one time had a decline in mmse score of 0.14 points per year compared to the those who did not fall , but this difference was not statistically significant ( p=0.4261 ) . in model 2 , \\n when high depressive symptoms was added to all variables in model 1 , the association between two or more falls decreased but remained statistically significant ( estimate = 0.64 , standard error = 0.19 , p=0.0007 ) : a decline of 0.64 points per year compared with those who did not fall . in model 3 , after adding medical conditions and hand grip muscle strength to model 2 , the association between two or more falls and mmse score remained statistically significant ( estimate = 0.46 , standard error = 0.19 , p=0.0161 ) : a decline of 0.46 points per year compared with those who did not fall . \\n female sex , high level of education , and high performance in hand grip muscle strength were associated with a lower decline in mmse scores . \\n figures 1 and 2 shows the unadjusted and adjusted mean distribution for the total mmse score over the 6-year period by falls status . \\n participants with two or more falls had lower total mmse scores than subjects with one fall or no falls over the follow - up period . \\n we also found that , among a cohort of cognitively normal elders , those with history of recurrent falls experienced a greater decline in their cognitive function over a 6-year period compared to those with no history of falls . \\n the fall  cognitive - decline association was independent of age , sex , marital status , and education . \\n presence of high depressive symptoms partially mediated the relationship between falls and cognitive decline . as expected , and consistent with prior studies , a high level of education and high performance in hand grip muscle strength \\n our findings are similar to prior studies and different from others.912,3335 most studies have looked at the falls  cognition association from the perspective of falls - related brain injury versus no injury as predictors of cognitive decline.3335 others have studied risks and consequences of falls in the dementia population , or gait disorders as predictors of cognitive decline or dementia , mostly in non - hispanic populations.36,37 ours is the first study to show that recurrent falls independently predict future cognitive decline in a cohort of community - dwelling hispanic elders with normal baseline cognitive measure . \\n it is not clear how recurrent falls predict cognitive decline , but one possibility is a shared risk factor for both falls and cognitive decline ( eg , strokes , shared brain network for cognition and gait control , low vitamin d , and brain amyloids).3841 for example , low vitamin d levels are associated with falls , depression , and cognitive impairments.38,39 a 12-month prospective cohort study of cognitively normal , community - dwelling older adults ( n=125 , mean age = 75 years ) showed that higher levels of brain amyloid ( pittsburgh compound b retention ) and of cerebrospinal fluid tau / a42 biomarker ratios were significantly associated with increased risk of falls.42 these amyloid imaging markers have been well described in persons with mild cognitive impairment and dementia.43,44 lack of amyloid imaging data precludes us from testing the association between amyloid burden and recurrent falls in our subjects with incident cognitive decline . \\n this is an important area for further study , using a combination of amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker . \\n were such an association proven , recurrent falls might alert clinicians to patients with high risk of future dementia . \\n the literature supports our findings of an association of falls with depressive symptoms and subsequent cognitive decline.1422,45 a 12-year longitudinal study of 2,425 cognitively intact adults showed that high depressive symptoms were associated with accelerated decline in memory , compared to low depressive symptoms as measured with the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale.45 this association suggests that older adults who fall should be monitored for depression . \\n another possible explanation for falls  cognitive - decline association is that recurrent fallers are simply sicker than non - fallers , with more conditions ( eg , diabetes , heart attacks ) that contribute to the mmse decline seen in recurrent fallers . \\n our study indicated that recurrent fallers at baseline were more likely than non - fallers to have lower handgrip muscle strength , hypertension , diabetes , heart attacks , and stroke . \\n our findings linking falls to cognitive decline still remained significant after adjustment for these conditions . \\n clearly , efforts to prevent falls - related disabilities require multidimensional approaches to address not just multiple risk factors , but also cognitive , physical , and emotional consequences of falls . \\n the world alzheimer report states that the earlier the diagnosis of dementia , the better the patients outcome.46 since falls appear to be a predictor of subsequent cognitive decline , health care professionals may be able to detect patients at risk for dementia and implement preventive strategies . \\n possibilities of such strategies include , but are not limited to , physical activity , mediterranean diet , and smoking cessation.6,21,26,43,46 clinically , our study also suggests that those who fell , even if cognitively intact , should be screened over time not only for cognitive impairment , but also for emergence of depressive symptomatology , with the expectation that such screening will trigger timely interventions to improve psychological health and reduce future falls . \\n depression in fallers could be caused by a fear of having another fall , a syndrome that may be amenable to interventions . \\n after a first fall , the fear of falling increases and could cause an adult to withdraw from activities as a defense against future falls . \\n this activity restriction may manifest as depression.1720 depression is thought to increase the likelihood of cognitive decline.10,11,47 however , caution should be used while prescribing antidepressants to patients who have fallen as studies have shown that these medications cause an increased risk in falling equal to that of untreated depression.16,48 nonpharmacological treatment of these patients may be the most effective option.16 our study has several limitations . \\n generalizability of our findings to other populations is limited because of the low educational attainment ( mean years = 6.3 ) and advanced age ( mean age = 80.8 years ) of our subjects . \\n the h - epese data for falls and comorbidities were self - reported , raising the possibility of recall bias , especially if participants have impaired cognition . \\n . we also could not confirm participant self - reports of medical conditions because of unavailability of participants medical records , radiologic imaging , and blood tests . \\n however , recent studies have validated the reliability of self - reports in studies on fears of falling in cognitively intact and impaired older adults and on barriers to mobility after stroke.49,50 the mmse is used primarily as a screening assessment for cognitive function and has limited sensitivity to detect changes over time , particularly in specialized areas of cognition . \\n thus , the rate of cognitive decline in our study may tend towards an underestimation . \\n our study has several strengths : large community -

square, analysis of variance, and post hoc tukey s tests were used to examine the distribution of covariates for participants by fall status at baseline. \\n general linear mixed models using the mixed procedure in sas ( sas institute, inc. \\n, cary, nc, usa ) were used to examine the factors associated with decline in cognitive function over a 6-year period as a function of fall status. \\n all variables were analyzed as time - dependent covariates ( potential to change as time progresses ) except age, sex, and education. \\n the mixed model was chosen for analysis because it best handles unbalanced data, allowing for modeling of both the time - dependent change in variables as well as the time - dependent change in the magnitude of association between variables. \\n in addition, because h - epese data comprised repeated measures over 6 years, mixed models allowed more flexibility in modeling the effects of time on outcome.31,32 three mixed models were constructed to test the relationship between fall status and cognitive decline over a 6-year period. model 1 included time, age, sex, marital status, years of formal education, and fall status. in model 2, depressive symptomatology was added to the variables in model 1. \\n medical conditions ( stroke, heart attack, hypertension, and diabetes ) were added to variables in model 3. \\n models 2 and 3 were performed to test whether high depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between falls and cognitive decline ( model 2 ) and to test whether the relationship between falls and cognitive decline remains statistically significant after adjusting for all covariates ( model 3 ). \\n all analyses were performed using the sas system for windows, version 9.2 ( sas institute, inc. ). \\n at baseline, the mean age for the 1,119 participants was 80.8 years ( range, 74109 ). sixty percent of the participants were female, 45.6% were married, and the mean years - of - education was 6.3 years ( range, 017 ). \\n sixty five percent of participants reported hypertension, 32.9% diabetes, 14.9% heart attack, 10.7% stroke, 5.6% hip fracture, and 11.9% had high depressive symptoms at baseline. \\n the prevalence of participants who fell once was 16.6% and was 14.7% for those who fell two or more times. \\n the mean mmse score was 25.53.1 for no falls, 24.93.0 for one fall, and 24.52.9 for two or more falls. \\n the difference was statistically significant between those who fell two or more times and those who did not fall ( p<0.05 ). \\n participants who fell two or more times were significantly more likely to be older, female, and to report higher levels of depressive symptoms, hypertension, diabetes, heart attack, and stroke compared to those with one fall or no falls. \\n no statistically significant association was seen with hip fracture. those who fell two or more times had lower performance in handgrip strength when compared with those with no falls ( p<0.05 ). \\n table 2 shows the general linear mixed model estimates for mmse score as a function of fall over a 6-year period \\n. the adjusted rate of decline in the total mmse score was 0.25 points per year ( model 1 ). \\n participants who fell two or more times had a greater decline in mmse score of 0.81 points per year ( p<0.0001 ) compared with those who did not fall, after adjusting for age, sex, marital status, and education ( model 1 ). \\n participants who fell one time had a decline in mmse score of 0.14 points per year compared to the those who did not fall, but this difference was not statistically significant ( p=0.4261 ). in model 2, \\n when high depressive symptoms was added to all variables in model 1, the association between two or more falls decreased but remained statistically significant ( estimate = 0.64, standard error = 0.19, p=0.0007 ) : a decline of 0.64 points per year compared with those who did not fall. in model 3, after adding medical conditions and hand grip muscle strength to model 2, the association between two or more falls and mmse score remained statistically significant ( estimate = 0.46, standard error = 0.19, p=0.0161 ) : a decline of 0.46 points per year compared with those who did not fall. \\n female sex, high level of education, and high performance in hand grip muscle strength were associated with a lower decline in mmse scores. \\n figures 1 and 2 shows the unadjusted and adjusted mean distribution for the total mmse score over the 6-year period by falls status. \\n participants with two or more falls had lower total mmse scores than subjects with one fall or no falls over the follow - up period. \\n we also found that, among a cohort of cognitively normal elders, those with history of recurrent falls experienced a greater decline in their cognitive function over a 6-year period compared to those with no history of falls. \\n the fall  cognitive -decline association was independent of age, sex, marital status, and education. \\n presence of high depressive symptoms partially mediated the relationship between falls and cognitive decline. as expected, and consistent with prior studies, a high level of education and high performance in hand grip muscle strength \\n our findings are similar to prior studies and different from others.912,3335 most studies have looked at the falls  cognition association from the perspective of falls - related brain injury versus no injury as predictors of cognitive decline.3335 others have studied risks and consequences of falls in the dementia population, or gait disorders as predictors of cognitive decline or dementia, mostly in non - hispanic populations.36,37 ours is the first study to show that recurrent falls independently predict future cognitive decline in a cohort of community - dwelling hispanic elders with normal baseline cognitive measure. \\n it is not clear how recurrent falls predict cognitive decline, but one possibility is a shared risk factor for both falls and cognitive decline ( eg, strokes, shared brain network for cognition and gait control, low vitamin d, and brain amyloids).3841 for example, low vitamin d levels are associated with falls, depression, and cognitive impairments.38,39 a 12-month prospective cohort study of cognitively normal, community - dwelling older adults ( n=125, mean age = 75 years ) showed that higher levels of brain amyloid ( pittsburgh compound b retention ) and of cerebrospinal fluid tau / a42 biomarker ratios were significantly associated with increased risk of falls.42 these amyloid imaging markers have been well described in persons with mild cognitive impairment and dementia.43,44 lack of amyloid imaging data precludes us from testing the association between amyloid burden and recurrent falls in our subjects with incident cognitive decline. \\n this is an important area for further study, using a combination of amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker. \\n were such an association proven, recurrent falls might alert clinicians to patients with high risk of future dementia. \\n the literature supports our findings of an association of falls with depressive symptoms and subsequent cognitive decline.1422,45 a 12-year longitudinal study of 2,425 cognitively intact adults showed that high depressive symptoms were associated with accelerated decline in memory, compared to low depressive symptoms as measured with the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale.45 this association suggests that older adults who fall should be monitored for depression. \\n another possible explanation for falls  cognitive -decline association is that recurrent fallers are simply sicker than non - fallers, with more conditions ( eg, diabetes, heart attacks ) that contribute to the mmse decline seen in recurrent fallers. \\n our study indicated that recurrent fallers at baseline were more likely than non - fallers to have lower handgrip muscle strength, hypertension, diabetes, heart attacks, and stroke. \\n our findings linking falls to cognitive decline still remained significant after adjustment for these conditions. \\n clearly, efforts to prevent falls - related disabilities require multidimensional approaches to address not just multiple risk factors, but also cognitive, physical, and emotional consequences of falls. \\n the world alzheimer report states that the earlier the diagnosis of dementia, the better the patients outcome.46 since falls appear to be a predictor of subsequent cognitive decline, health care professionals may be able to detect patients at risk for dementia and implement preventive strategies. \\n possibilities of such strategies include, but are not limited to, physical activity, mediterranean diet, and smoking cessation.6,21,26,43,46 clinically, our study also suggests that those who fell, even if cognitively intact, should be screened over time not only for cognitive impairment, but also for emergence of depressive symptomatology, with the expectation that such screening will trigger timely interventions to improve psychological health and reduce future falls. \\n depression in fallers could be caused by a fear of having another fall, a syndrome that may be amenable to interventions. \\n after a first fall, the fear of falling increases and could cause an adult to withdraw from activities as a defense against future falls. \\n this activity restriction may manifest as depression.1720 depression is thought to increase the likelihood of cognitive decline.10,11,47 however, caution should be used while prescribing antidepressants to patients who have fallen as studies have shown that these medications cause an increased risk in falling equal to that of untreated depression.16,48 nonpharmacological treatment of these patients may be the most effective option.16 our study has several limitations. \\n generalizability of our findings to other populations is limited because of the low educational attainment ( mean years = 6.3 ) and advanced age ( mean age = 80.8 years ) of our subjects. \\n the h - epese data for falls and comorbidities were self - reported, raising the possibility of recall bias, especially if participants have impaired cognition. \\n. we also could not confirm participant self - reports of medical conditions because of unavailability of participants medical records, radiologic imaging, and blood tests. \\n however, recent studies have validated the reliability of self - reports in studies on fears of falling in cognitively intact and impaired older adults and on barriers to mobility after stroke.49,50 the mmse is used primarily as a screening assessment for cognitive function and has limited sensitivity to detect changes over time, particularly in specialized areas of cognition. \\n thus, the rate of cognitive decline in our study may tend towards an underestimation. \\n our study has several strengths : large community - based sample, prospective design, and exploration of the potential role of falls and depression in cognitive disablement in older mexican americans ( a rapidly growing segment of us elderly population ). \\n another important strength of our study is the use of mixed models, an analytic approach that allowed the use of all available data and evaluation of time - dependent effects. \\n in conclusion, having recurrent falls was independently associated with steeper decline in cognition over 6 years compared to having no history of falls, with a mediating effect of depression on the association between falls and cognitive decline. \\n the findings suggest that screening for cognitive and emotional problems in recurrent fallers might help stem the onset of falls - related physical and cognitive disability. \\n future studies should explore the best way to screen for and treat depression and fear of falling in older adults who have fallen.\\n\\n### Response:\\nannually, falls occur in about one third of community -

ups ( wave 6 and wave 7 ). \\n we excluded those with a mmse score < 21 ( n=681)25 because we were interested in examining how falls and high depressive symptoms influenced changes in cognitive function in those with normal or high cognition. also, we excluded those with missing information on the mmse ( n=199 ). \\n participants with missing information on the mmse and those with mmse < 21 were significantly more likely to be older, have low level of education, perform lower in hand grip strength, report less hypertension, and report more stroke, hip fracture, high depressive symptoms, and falls compared with those with mmse 21. after excluding participants with an mmse score < 21 at baseline and those with missing data on mmse, fall status, and all covariates, the final sample consisted of 1,119 participants. \\n subjects excluded were significantly more likely to be older, unmarried, and to have reported more hypertension, stroke, hip fractures, and high depressive symptoms. they were also more likely to have less education, a lower mmse score, and have had two or more falls. \\n fall status was established by asking the participants at each interview the following question :  during the last 12 months, how many times did you fall and land on the floor or ground?  fall status was categorized as having no falls, having one fall, or having two or more falls. \\n scored on a 30-point scale, the mmse screens for difficulties in episodic memory, orientation, working memory, naming, language, and image copying.26,27 higher scores indicate better cognition. \\n interviewers were thoroughly trained in administering and scoring the mmse, through both workshops and videotaped instruction. \\n the english and spanish versions of the mmse were adopted from the diagnostic interview scale used in prior community surveys.28 this spanish version of the mmse has met standard criteria for development of translated tests, including formal translation, back - translation, and consensus by committee for final item content. \\n additionally, the spanish mmse has been successfully used in community surveys of mexican americans.29 baseline sociodemographic variables included age, sex, marital status, and years of education. \\n the presence of various medical conditions was determined with a series of questions asking participants if a doctor had ever told them that they had diabetes, heart attack, stroke, or hypertension. \\n depressive symptomatology was measured with the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale.30 this scale consists of 20 items that ask how often specific symptoms were experienced during the past week ; responses were scored on a 4-point scale ( ranging from rarely or none of the time to most or all of the time : 0, 1, 2, 3 ) with potential total scores ranging 060. \\n as is common in the literature, we consider persons scoring 16 or over to experience high depressive symptomatology.10,11,30 \\n fall status was established by asking the participants at each interview the following question :  during the last 12 months, how many times did you fall and land on the floor or ground?  fall status was categorized as having no falls, having one fall, or having two or more falls. \\n scored on a 30-point scale, the mmse screens for difficulties in episodic memory, orientation, working memory, naming, language, and image copying.26,27 higher scores indicate better cognition. \\n interviewers were thoroughly trained in administering and scoring the mmse, through both workshops and videotaped instruction. \\n the english and spanish versions of the mmse were adopted from the diagnostic interview scale used in prior community surveys.28 this spanish version of the mmse has met standard criteria for development of translated tests, including formal translation, back -

square, analysis of variance, and post hoc tukey s tests were used to examine the distribution of covariates for participants by fall status at baseline. \\n general linear mixed models using the mixed procedure in sas ( sas institute, inc. \\n, cary, nc, usa ) were used to examine the factors associated with decline in cognitive function over a 6-year period as a function of fall status. \\n all variables were analyzed as time - dependent covariates ( potential to change as time progresses ) except age, sex, and education. \\n the mixed model was chosen for analysis because it best handles unbalanced data, allowing for modeling of both the time - dependent change in variables as well as the time - dependent change in the magnitude of association between variables. \\n in addition, because h - epese data comprised repeated measures over 6 years, mixed models allowed more flexibility in modeling the effects of time on outcome.31,32 three mixed models were constructed to test the relationship between fall status and cognitive decline over a 6-year period. model 1 included time, age, sex, marital status, years of formal education, and fall status. in model 2, depressive symptomatology was added to the variables in model 1. \\n medical conditions ( stroke, heart attack, hypertension, and diabetes ) were added to variables in model 3. \\n models 2 and 3 were performed to test whether high depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between falls and cognitive decline ( model 2 ) and to test whether the relationship between falls and cognitive decline remains statistically significant after adjusting for all covariates ( model 3 ). \\n all analyses were performed using the sas system for windows, version 9.2 ( sas institute, inc. ). \\n at baseline, the mean age for the 1,119 participants was 80.8 years ( range, 74109 ). sixty percent of the participants were female, 45.6% were married, and the mean years - of - education was 6.3 years ( range, 017 ). \\n sixty five percent of participants reported hypertension, 32.9% diabetes, 14.9% heart attack'},\n",

       "  'input': \"more than 60% of adult females in   the united states have abdominal obesity , a condition that independently predicts mortality , major morbidities , and metabolic risk factors   in women . \\n recent data suggest that waist circumference and the prevalence of abdominal obesity continue to increase . \\n women may be at greater risk for abdominal obesity due to weight gain following pregnancy   and/or hormonal fluctuations at menopause , which shift body fat distribution from peripheral regions to the abdomen . \\n current expert guidelines recommend initiating weight loss treatment in women whose waist circumference is > 88  cm ( or bmi 25 to 29.9  kg / m ) and who have two or more comorbidities , such as type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) , hypertension , or dyslipidemia . \\n although abdominal fat decreases with weight loss , there is no consensus on an appropriate evidence - based preventive and treatment nutrition model to control abdominal obesity , and dietary interventions to sustain long - term weight loss ( > 1 year ) have not been identified . \\n many investigations of abdominal obesity measures and diet have focused on single - nutrients ( e.g. , alcohol , fat , protein ) ; however , identification of the isolated nutritional effects is confounded in observational research by the coexistence of dietary factors in the foods we eat . \\n examination of the total diet and nutrient intake patterns of individuals may provide better measures of diet exposure , helping identify individuals who may benefit from targeted nutritional risk interventions [ 9 , 10 ] . \\n few studies have evaluated overall dietary quality using composite dietary indices / scores in relation to abdominal adiposity , [ 1016 ] and the majority are cross - sectional investigations [ 1115 ] . \\n further , none of the existing composite dietary quality indices / scores are based on a specific evidence basis for the most consistent dietary determinants of abdominal or peripheral obesity . \\n the concept of a disease - specific dietary quality index is unique and important since general indices without disease - specificity have not been predictive of all major chronic diseases in women [ 17 , 18 ] . \\n a dietary quality index / score that combines specific dietary determinants of obesity may be more helpful than existing approaches in identifying diet - obesity associations and may offer new insights into nutritional risk assessment , preventive intervention and treatment for abdominal obesity risk reduction . \\n a nutrient - based approach , such as this , is appropriate because nutrient targeting influences patterns of food intake [ 9 , 19 , 20 ] , and the core of all us population - based dietary guidelines and nutrition policy for maintaining health focus on achieving optimal nutrient intake with both nutrient and food - based messages . \\n this investigation prospectively examined the relationship between dietary quality and development of abdominal obesity in women , which has not been adequately addressed in current literature . \\n we evaluated the ability of a novel obesity - specific nutritional risk score ( onrs ) to predict development of abdominal obesity over 12 years in healthy women . \\n the framingham study is a longitudinal population - based investigation that began in 1948 to study the progression of cvd . \\n briefly , cohort members were 5209 men and women , aged 28 to 62 years , from the town of framingham , ma .   in 1971 , \\n 5124 adult children and their spouses of the original cohort were invited to participate in the framingham offspring - spouse study ( fos ) .   this second - generation cohort ( 2483 men and 2641 women ) participated in clinical examinations every 4 years , on average . \\n each clinical visit , conducted according to a standardized protocol , consists of an updated , detailed medical history and a complete physical exam with laboratory and noninvasive diagnostic testing .    of the 1956 women who attended the third examination ( exam 3 , 19841988 ) , only 1265 ( 65% ) \\n of those 1265 women , 288 were not abdominally obese ( waist circumference 88  cm ) , aged 30 to 69 years , and presented without cvd ( including coronary heart disease and stroke ) , cancer , diabetes or metabolic syndrome ( mets ) risk factors at baseline ( exam 4 , 19881992 ) , and comprise the sample for these analyses \\n .   waist circumference was first assessed at exam 4 ; therefore , evaluation of baseline characteristics and covariates , except physical activity ( exam 2 ) , also come from this exam . \\n diet exposure is exam 3 , not exam 4 , for these analyses because this is the collection time point for the 3-day dietary records ; this approach is consistent with other published fos research . \\n follow - up was assessed through exam 7 ( 19982001 ) for a total of 12 years . \\n all protocols were approved by the human subjects institutional review board of the boston university medical campus and boston medical center . \\n diet was assessed from 3-day dietary records completed at the exam 3 clinic visit according to standardized research protocols [ 22 , 23 ] . \\n participants were instructed by a registered dietitian to record all foods consumed over 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day without deviation in their current eating behavior .   to quantify portion sizes , \\n nutrient intake calculations were performed using the minnesota nutrition data system software ( version 2.6 ; food database 6a ; nutrient database 23 ; nutrition coordinating center , university of minnesota , minneapolis , mn ) . \\n we previously validated our approach to composite nutrient risk score assessment in this cohort   and we used this approach to construct the obesity - specific nutritional risk score ( onrs ) . \\n the new onrs is based on dietary factors that have been shown to either promote or protect - against general obesity [ 2427 ] . \\n potential components of the nutritional risk score were identified by reviewing existing dietary composite indices [ 9 , 28 , 29 ] , as well as the extensive literature on diet and obesity in human studies . \\n we selected eleven components to include in the onrs : total energy ( kj ) , energy density ( kj / g ) , carbohydrate ( % energy ) , protein ( % energy ) , total , monounsaturated , polyunsaturated , and saturated fats ( % energy ) , fiber ( g/4184  kj ) , calcium ( mg/4184  kj ) , and alcohol ( % energy ) . \\n the methodology used to calculate the onrs is similar to that of our previously validated framingham nutritional risk score as described in the original validation of dietary patterns in the fos cohort . \\n ranking of individual nutrients in the score is based on the number of women in the sample where each nutrient is ranked from 1 ( low risk ) to 288 ( high risk ) for every woman with completed 3-day dietary records . \\n ranks are assigned so that a woman with a desirable nutrient intake level ( protective nutrients ) receives a lower rank while a woman with an undesirable nutrient intake level ( risk - promoting nutrients ) receives a higher rank . \\n energy , energy density , alcohol , and total , saturated , monounsaturated , and polyunsaturated fat intakes were ranked low to high , whereas protein , carbohydrate , fiber , and calcium intakes were ranked high to low . \\n the mean ranks of each individual nutrient are used to calculate the overall nutritional risk score of each woman . \\n monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats were ranked as risk - promoting nutrients in contrast to some reports suggesting that they   may be protective [ 30 , 31 ] . \\n this was done because the majority of monounsaturated fat consumed by fos women in this time - frame was derived from animal sources with higher saturated fat content rather than plant sources , and the polyunsaturated fat levels contained partially hydrogenated margarine rather than marine or plant oils . \\n the main outcome was development of abdominal obesity at any time point during follow - up . \\n abdominal obesity was defined according to the recommended waist circumference level for women ( > 88  cm ) . \\n waist circumference was measured at clinic visits at the umbilicus with participants standing and the tape measure parallel to the floor , according to standard protocol . \\n metabolic and anthropometric measurements are routinely collected at clinic visits according to validated methods [ 32 , 33 ] : systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( duplicate measurements ) , fasting lipids [ total cholesterol , high density lipoprotein ( hdl ) , low density lipoprotein ( ldl ) , and triglycerides ] , fasting glucose , and bmi ( height and weight ) .   the national cholesterol education program 's adult treatment panel iii cutoffs were used to evaluate each woman 's mets risk factors . \\n women were considered to be free of mets risk factors according to the following criteria :   glucose < 110  mg / dl , blood pressure < 130/<85  mmhg , triglycerides < 150  mg / dl , hdl > 50  mg / dl , and waist circumference 88  cm . selected socio - demographic and behavioral characteristics \\n self - reported dietary behavior was evaluated using the framingham food habit questionnaire and included adherence to a modified diet ( currently  on a diet  ) and usual weight pattern described as stable ( 5 pounds ) or fluctuating ( 10 pounds ) body weight . \\n other self - reported characteristics included age , smoking status , physical activity , parity , menopausal status , and use of hormone replacement therapy . \\n physical activity was assessed using a standardized questionnaire   at exam 2 ( 19791983 ) and not at exam 3 ; these values were used in the analyses consistent with published framingham protocols . \\n age - adjusted mean levels of baseline characteristics and nutrient intakes were computed for each nutritional risk score tertile . \\n the glm procedure in sas ( analysis of covariance ) was used to compute age - adjusted means for continuous variables .   logistic regression ( sas procedure logistic ) was used to compute age - adjusted proportions for dichotomous variables . \\n bonferroni 's correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons in analyses of baseline characteristics and nutrient intakes . \\n the primary research goal was to examine the association between dietary quality , assessed by the onrs , and development of abdominal obesity . \\n stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate other variables that were related to abdominal obesity . \\n after the stepwise regression , we constructed a final model to establish that the variables did not attenuate the onrs - abdominal obesity relationship . \\n the final , fixed model included the following variables : age ( continuous ) , physical activity ( continuous ) , menopausal status ( yes / no ) and smoking status ( never , former , or current smokers ) .    metabolic , anthropometric , and demographic variables that did not differ at baseline according to nutritional risk score tertile were not identified as confounders and were thus not added to the model . \\n odds ratios ( ors ) were calculated for each nutritional risk score tertile of the onrs with the lowest tertile as the referent group . \\n the p - value for trend was determined using the tertile groups of the onrs in a continuous form . \\n secondary analyses adjusting for age , physical activity , menopausal status , and smoking status , were conducted to determine the relationship of individual nutrient risk score components to abdominal obesity . \\n intakes of each index component were ranked low to high and categorized into tertiles , and ors were calculated for each intake tertile with the lowest tertile as the referent group . \\n the p - value for trend was determined using the tertile groups of intake for each individual nutrient in a continuous form . \\n all analyses were performed using sas software ( version 9.1 ; 2003 , sas institute , cary , nc ) . \\n at baseline , women with higher dietary quality ( i.e. , lowest nutritional risk tertile ) were significantly older and smoked less during their lifetimes ( table 1 ) . \\n their metabolic profiles reflect the health status of this disease - free cohort at baseline ; their blood pressure , total cholesterol , ldl , hdl , triglyceride , and blood glucose levels were within normal ranges . \\n relative to women with higher dietary quality ( i.e. , lowest nutritional risk tertile ) , women with the poorest dietary quality ( i.e. , highest nutritional risk tertile ) had lower intakes of fiber , calcium , protein , and carbohydrate , higher energy - dense diets , and higher intakes of total energy , alcohol and total , saturated , polyunsaturated , and monounsaturated fats . \\n the overall incidence of abdominal obesity over 12 years was ~52% ( n = 149 ; table 3 ) . \\n the onrs was directly related to abdominal obesity ( p for trend = .048 ) .   in multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for age , physical activity , menopause , and smoking status , \\n women in the highest nutritional risk tertile were 1.87 ( 95% ci , 1.01 , 3.47 ) times more likely to become abdominally obese compared to those in the lowest tertile of nutritional risk .    in secondary analyses that explored all onrs nutrients individually , \\n carbohydrate intake was inversely associated , while monounsaturated fat intake was positively associated , with development of abdominal obesity ( p for trend < .05 ) .   in multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for age , physical activity , menopause , and smoking status , \\n compared to the lowest tertile of intake , odds of becoming abdominally obese were lower in the highest tertile of carbohydrate intake ( or 0.50 ; 95% ci , 0.27 , 0.92 ) and higher in the highest tertile of monounsaturated fat intake ( or 1.91 ; 95% ci , 1.04 , 3.52 ) . \\n we evaluated dietary quality and its relationship to abdominal obesity using an 11-nutrient obesity - specific composite dietary risk index / score developed in the fos . \\n the onrs predicted development of abdominal obesity over 12 years in women , aged 30 to 69 years , who were free of disease and mets risk factors at baseline . \\n women with eating habits of poorest dietary quality ( i.e. , highest nutritional risk ) consumed diets that were significantly lower in protein , carbohydrate , fiber , and calcium , and higher in total calories , energy - density , total fat , and alcohol . \\n our longitudinal findings support those of cross - sectional studies investigating the association of a priori dietary quality indices / scores and abdominal adiposity [ 1113 , 15 ] . \\n for example , fogli - cawley et al .    found that adults in the highest quartile of the 2005 dietary guidelines adherence index ( dgai ) had the lowest waist circumference compared to those in the lowest quartile ( 90  cm versus 96  cm ; p for trend across 2005 dgai quintiles < .001 ) . \\n the 2005-dgai uses 20 criteria , each with a maximum value of 1 , reflecting key dietary recommendations in the 2005 dietary guidelines for americans . \\n these results are also consistent with earlier research using the framingham nutritional risk score ( fnrs ) , a 19-nutrient cvd - oriented nutritional risk index , which also predicted abdominal obesity in fos women . \\n compared to women with higher dietary quality ( i.e. , lowest nutritional risk ) , those with poorer dietary quality ( i.e. , highest nutritional risk ) had more than a twofold risk of developing abdominal obesity ( or 2.3 ; 95% ci , 1.2 , 4.3 ) . \\n an advantage of the onrs , however , is that it incorporates new foci of research , such as energy density and evidence - based predictors of obesity - related outcomes ( e.g. , carbohydrate , protein , fat , fiber , calcium , and total calories ) . \\n synergistic mechanisms among nutrients in the onrs may be modulating metabolic pathways that may lead to excess abdominal fat .    the lower fat and energy - density combined with higher fiber and protein intakes in women consuming a higher quality diet may reduce circulating levels of glucose and free - fatty acids , which may prevent insulin resistance and/or high insulin levels , leading to decreased visceral fat storage [ 3739 ] . the role of diet in abdominal fat accumulation , however , is not clearly established . \\n the findings of single - nutrient analyses by halkjaer et al .   did not show total energy or macronutrient intake as a predictor of five - year changes in waist circumference in adults . to our knowledge , we are among the first to prospectively examine development of abdominal obesity and nutrient intake patterns using an obesity - specific dietary quality index / score with a specific energy density component and other evidence - based predictors of obesity .   the results of these analyses suggest that overall dietary quality influences abdominal adiposity independent of age , physical activity , smoking , and menopausal status . \\n composite dietary quality appears more informative than the single nutrient approach in determining risk of abdominal obesity . \\n while the onrs can not be directly applied  as is  , dietary quality and intakes of the nutrients that comprise the score could become a new focus as these results are translated into public policy and assessment , prevention and treatment recommendations for abdominal obesity . \\n specifically , future translational research would assess nutrient - related risk using the onrs combined with an evaluation of established dietary patterns   to identify food- and nutrient - based targets for preventive intervention to help control abdominal weight gain . \\n as this type of translational research progresses , we could then encourage that nutrition interventions be guided by use of both a composite nutrient index and dietary pattern approach .   in a recent randomized controlled clinical trial , \\n a calorie - reduced diet modeled on the dietary approaches to stop hypertension ( dash ) protocol resulted in a significantly greater weight loss and reduction in waist circumferences in overweight and obese women after 6 months ( 14  kg , p = .03 and 5  cm , p = .04 , resp . ) than the control group ( + 1  kg , ns and 1  cm , ns , resp . ) . \\n the dash diet plan emphasizes fruits , vegetables , low - fat dairy , whole grains , poultry , fish , and nuts and is higher in calcium and magnesium and lower in total and saturated fat . \\n it is important to note that longer term efficacy of this dietary protocol was not determined and that this protocol may be difficult for some individuals to follow for extended periods , particularly if it requires major changes in habitual eating behavior and is not compatible with personal preferences and tastes .   a dietary quality approach that targets obesity - specific nutrients , as demonstrated by the onrs , combined with approaches that are informed by habitual eating patterns offers an alternative methodology . \\n this current research suggests that opportunities exist for a new intervention paradigm that promotes improved nutrient quality while retaining the beneficial aspects of the individual 's established eating pattern . \\n although our results suggest that higher intakes of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats may increase a woman 's risk of abdominal weight gain , it is important to emphasize that the food sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats consumed by fos women in the mid-1980s baseline time - frame were not derived from protective plant sources , but rather animal sources high in saturated fat and partially hydrogenated margarines potentially high in trans fat , respectively .   the increased risk of abdominal obesity associated with saturated and trans fat has been demonstrated in animal   and human [ 43 , 44 ] investigations .   further , current clinical trial literature has demonstrated a protective effect of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats derived from plant oils on central fat distribution [ 45 , 46 ] . \\n if the onrs were to be applied to more recent dietary data , it would seem important to alter the scoring of these fat subtypes to reflect current diets . \\n in addition , given that the scoring system is based on ranking within a study population , direct application of the onrs is not advised at this time . \\n future translational research needs to determine an optimal method of ranking individuals in other populations .   before we would advocate a direct translation of this index , we would wish to conduct a formal translational research study similar to one we conducted with fos food - based dietary patterns developed from cluster analyses [ 9 , 47 ] . \\n translational research of this nature was beyond the scope of the present study but the importance of carrying out such analytical research seems supported by our present findings . \\n the major strength of this study is the longitudinal design with long duration of follow - up and direct measurement of the outcome variable ( i.e. , waist circumference ) , as opposed to self - report . \\n additionally , the onrs is nutrient - based , which is consistent with the foundation of the dietary guidelines for americans   for determining adequacy of intake and overall dietary quality . \\n other strengths include calculation of dietary quality using energy - adjusted index components and consideration of a wide range of potential confounders in stepwise analyses with the final fixed model adjusted for age , physical activity , smoking , and menopausal status . \\n in addition , our methodology of including only components associated with obesity in the onrs potentially increased the diagnostic accuracy of the index . \\n this is a methodological strength in dietary quality index construction that has recently been noted by kourlaba and panagiotakos .   and \\n although our scoring system approach , in which components of the onrs are weighted equally , is consistent with other dietary quality indices [ 28 , 29 ] , ongoing work is required to refine the use and construction of such indices . \\n our outcome was development of abdominal obesity ; therefore , it was critical to exclude women with abdominal obesity and those with related risk factors at baseline . \\n the fact that fewer than 25% of women in the fos cohort met the inclusion criteria underscores the high prevalence of abdominal obesity and related metabolic risk factors .   despite the smaller number of women included in this investigation \\n , we were able to demonstrate the predictive validity between a lower quality diet and abdominal obesity . \\n another limitation is the use of 3-day dietary records which may introduce error as they have been reported to underestimate intake   and are subject to reporting bias . \\n we attempted to partially correct for energy misreporting in that all nutrients are energy - adjusted in the index using the nutrient - density method ( i.e. , % kcal or unit of nutrient/4184  kj ) as discussed in a recent systematic review . \\n nonetheless , it is our view that in this lean sample of women at baseline , energy mis - reporting ( notably over - reporting ) would likely have attenuated the results and led to a failure to detect a relationship between dietary quality and abdominal obesity .   while it is also true that we can not assess nutritional risk over time , intakes in the fos cohort \\n we also note the potential for bias in our sample since of the 1956 women who attended exam 3 , only 1265 completed a 3-day dietary record .   previously , we have compared women who completed the 3-day dietary records to those who did not . \\n women who completed the records were older ( ~49 years versus ~47 years ) , had lower bmis ( 25 versus 26 ) , and were more likely to be nonsmokers . \\n further , these results may not be generalizable to women outside of the fos as 98% of these women are white and eating patterns and nutrient intakes may differ by ethnicity . \\n we further recognize the importance of socio - economic status ; however , information on this and other potential confounders was not available for these analyses .    in conclusion , we identified a relationship between dietary quality assessed using an obesity - specific dietary quality index / score and accumulation of central body fat . \\n an energy - adjusted , nutrient - based risk score , like the onrs , identifies important components of nutritional risk assessment for abdominal obesity prevention in women and suggests that new opportunities exist for preventive nutrition intervention paradigms that target specific improvements in dietary quality in the context of the individual 's nutrient intake pattern .   as future research moves to a translational model \\n , the nutrient components of interest can be translated into targeted food sources , which can be used to guide improvements by establishing guidelines for the counseling process and optimal approaches to dietary interventions . \\n strategies of this nature are crucial in planning and implementing programs for abdominal and peripheral obesity risk reduction and individualized treatment recommendations .\",\n",

oriented nutritional risk index, which also predicted abdominal obesity in fos women. \\n compared to women with higher dietary quality ( i.e., lowest nutritional risk ), those with poorer dietary quality ( i.e., highest nutritional risk ) had more than a twofold risk of developing abdominal obesity ( or 2.3 ; 95% ci, 1.2, 4.3 ). \\n an advantage of the onrs, however, is that it incorporates new foci of research, such as energy density and evidence - based predictors of obesity - related outcomes ( e.g., carbohydrate, protein, fat, fiber, calcium, and total calories ). \\n synergistic mechanisms among nutrients in the onrs may be modulating metabolic pathways that may lead to excess abdominal fat.    the lower fat and energy - density combined with higher fiber and protein intakes in women consuming a higher quality diet may reduce circulating levels of glucose and free - fatty acids, which may prevent insulin resistance and/or high insulin levels, leading to decreased visceral fat storage [ 3739 ]. the role of diet in abdominal fat accumulation, however, is not clearly established. \\n the findings of single - nutrient analyses by halkjaer et al.   did not show total energy or macronutrient intake as a predictor of five - year changes in waist circumference in adults. to our knowledge, we are among the first to prospectively examine development of abdominal obesity and nutrient intake patterns using an obesity - specific dietary quality index / score with a specific energy density component and other evidence - based predictors of obesity.   the results of these analyses suggest that overall dietary quality influences abdominal adiposity independent of age, physical activity, smoking, and menopausal status. \\n composite dietary quality appears more informative than the single nutrient approach in determining risk of abdominal obesity. \\n while the onrs can not be directly applied  as is , dietary quality and intakes of the nutrients that comprise the score could become a new focus as these results are translated into public policy and assessment, prevention and treatment recommendations for abdominal obesity. \\n specifically, future translational research would assess nutrient - related risk using the onrs combined with an evaluation of established dietary patterns   to identify food- and nutrient - based targets for preventive intervention to help control abdominal weight gain. \\n as this type of translational research progresses, we could then encourage that nutrition interventions be guided by use of both a composite nutrient index and dietary pattern approach.   in a recent randomized controlled clinical trial, \\n a calorie - reduced diet modeled on the dietary approaches to stop hypertension ( dash ) protocol resulted in a significantly greater weight loss and reduction in waist circumferences in overweight and obese women after 6 months ( 14  kg, p =.03 and 5  cm, p =.04, resp. ) than the control group ( + 1  kg, ns and 1  cm, ns, resp. ). \\n the dash diet plan emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low - fat dairy, whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts and is higher in calcium and magnesium and lower in total and saturated fat. \\n it is important to note that longer term efficacy of this dietary protocol was not determined and that this protocol may be difficult for some individuals to follow for extended periods, particularly if it requires major changes in habitual eating behavior and is not compatible with personal preferences and tastes.   a dietary quality approach that targets obesity - specific nutrients, as demonstrated by the onrs, combined with approaches that are informed by habitual eating patterns offers an alternative methodology. \\n this current research suggests that opportunities exist for a new intervention paradigm that promotes improved nutrient quality while retaining the beneficial aspects of the individual's established eating pattern. \\n although our results suggest that higher intakes of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats may increase a woman's risk of abdominal weight gain, it is important to emphasize that the food sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats consumed by fos women in the mid-1980s baseline time - frame were not derived from protective plant sources, but rather animal sources high in saturated fat and partially hydrogenated margarines potentially high in trans fat, respectively.   the increased risk of abdominal obesity associated with saturated and trans fat has been demonstrated in animal   and human [ 43, 44 ] investigations.   further, current clinical trial literature has demonstrated a protective effect of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats derived from plant oils on central fat distribution [ 45, 46 ]. \\n if the onrs were to be applied to more recent dietary data, it would seem important to alter the scoring of these fat subtypes to reflect current diets. \\n in addition, given that the scoring system is based on ranking within a study population, direct application of the onrs is not advised at this time. \\n future translational research needs to determine an optimal method of ranking individuals in other populations.   before we would advocate a direct translation of this index, we would wish to conduct a formal translational research study similar to one we conducted with fos food - based dietary patterns developed from cluster analyses [ 9, 47 ]. \\n translational research of this nature was beyond the scope of the present study but the importance of carrying out such analytical research seems supported by our present findings. \\n the major strength of this study is the longitudinal design with long duration of follow - up and direct measurement of the outcome variable ( i.e., waist circumference ), as opposed to self - report. \\n additionally, the onrs is nutrient - based, which is consistent with the foundation of the dietary guidelines for americans   for determining adequacy of intake and overall dietary quality. \\n other strengths include calculation of dietary quality using energy - adjusted index components and consideration of a wide range of potential confounders in stepwise analyses with the final fixed model adjusted for age, physical activity, smoking, and menopausal status. \\n in addition, our methodology of including only components associated with obesity in the onrs potentially increased the diagnostic accuracy of the index. \\n this is a methodological strength in dietary quality index construction that has recently been noted by kourlaba and panagiotakos.   and \\n although our scoring system approach, in which components of the onrs are weighted equally, is consistent with other dietary quality indices [ 28, 29 ], ongoing work is required to refine the use and construction of such indices. \\n our outcome was development of abdominal obesity ; therefore, it was critical to exclude women with abdominal obesity and those with related risk factors at baseline. \\n the fact that fewer than 25% of women in the fos cohort met the inclusion criteria underscores the high prevalence of abdominal obesity and related metabolic risk factors.   despite the smaller number of women included in this investigation \\n, we were able to demonstrate the predictive validity between a lower quality diet and abdominal obesity. \\n another limitation is the use of 3-day dietary records which may introduce error as they have been reported to underestimate intake   and are subject to reporting bias. \\n we attempted to partially correct for energy misreporting in that all nutrients are energy - adjusted in the index using the nutrient - density method ( i.e., % kcal or unit of nutrient/4184  kj ) as discussed in a recent systematic review. \\n nonetheless, it is our view that in this lean sample of women at baseline, energy mis - reporting ( notably over - reporting ) would likely have attenuated the results and led to a failure to detect a relationship between dietary quality and abdominal obesity.   while it is also true that we can not assess nutritional risk over time, intakes in the fos cohort \\n we also note the potential for bias in our sample since of the 1956 women who attended exam 3, only 1265 completed a 3-day dietary record.   previously, we have compared women who completed the 3-day dietary records to those who did not. \\n women who completed the records were older ( ~49 years versus ~47 years ), had lower bmis ( 25 versus 26 ), and were more likely to be nonsmokers. \\n further, these results may not be generalizable to women outside of the fos as 98% of these women are white and eating patterns and nutrient intakes may differ by ethnicity. \\n we further recognize the importance of socio - economic status ; however, information on this and other potential confounders was not available for these analyses.    in conclusion, we identified a relationship between dietary quality assessed using an obesity - specific dietary quality index / score and accumulation of central body fat. \\n an energy - adjusted, nutrient - based risk score, like the onrs, identifies important components of nutritional risk assessment for abdominal obesity prevention in women and suggests that new opportunities exist for preventive nutrition intervention paradigms that target specific improvements in dietary quality in the context of the individual's nutrient intake pattern.   as future research moves to a translational model \\n, the nutrient components of interest can be translated into targeted food sources, which can be used to guide improvements by establishing guidelines for the counseling process and optimal approaches to dietary interventions. \\n strategies of this nature are crucial in planning and implementing programs for abdominal and peripheral obesity risk reduction and individualized treatment recommendations.\"},\n",

       "  'model_output': \"the purpose of the root canal obturation is to provide a tight seal that prevents reinfection of the canal and subsequent leakage of fluid and antigenic agents into or from the periradicular tissues. nowadays, there is increasing demand for prompt, simple and efficient obturation technique, which improves practice and causes less stress for patients and clinicians. with the widespread use of rotary niti instruments and matched - taper gutta - percha cones, the single - cone obturation technique has become popular. with the aim of improving the marginal sealing properties of root canal filling, new root canal filling systems have been recently developed such as realseal se and guttaflow2 systems, which may encourage the practitioners to use the single - cone obturation technique. the reaseal se system consists of a self - etching methacrylate sealer and resilon core material. it is claimed to reduce the application steps of the ordinary epiphany system, thus becoming a more user - friendly material and bonds to both the resilon core and radicular dentin through hybrid layers on both substrates leading to a monoblock unit, which may prevent leakage and improve the root strength. guttaflow2 ( coltene / whaledent, altsttten, switzerland ) is a cold flowable ; self - curing material and composed of gutta - percha powder, polydimethylsiloxane and nano silver particles. it has a better seal and good adaptability because of its high flowability and setting expansion. the sealing ability is a basic feature that needs to be tested for every root canal filling material or technique. a variety of laboratory - based experimental methods are used to detect and measure leakage along root fillings. these methods include dye penetration, spectrometry of radioisotopes, fluorometric and electrometric methods, bacterial penetration and fluid transport model. xu et al. discussed a new non - destructive model that measures the leakage of glucose molecules quantitatively by using a spectrophotometer. the aim of the present study was to evaluate corono - apical microleakage along root canal fillings using glucose leakage model by comparing three matched - taper single - cone filling systems with cold gutta - percha lateral compaction technique using glucose leakage model at different time intervals. the following combinations were used as a single - cone filling technique : gutta - percha / ah plus, gutta - percha / guttaflow2 and resilon / realseal se. the crowns were cut below the cemento - enamel junction so that the length of roots was standardized at 15 mm. the working length was determined and the canals were instrumented by profile niti rotary instruments ( dentsply maillefer ) to size 35/0.06 using the crown - down technique. the canals were irrigated after using each file with 5 ml of 3% sodium hypochlorite ( naocl ) solution using vibringe ultrasonic dental irrigation syringe ( medgadget ) and a 27-gauge max - i - probe needle ( dentsply maillefer ). after finishing the instrumentation, the prepared canals were rinsed with 5 ml of 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) solution for 2 min followed by 10 ml distilled water as final irrigation to remove any traces of naocl. after drying all canals, the samples were divided according to the obturation technique and materials into four experimental groups of 20 samples each and two control groups of 5 samples each [ table 1 ]. samples in the negative control group did not receive root canal fillings while in the positive control group they were obturated with a single - cone gutta - percha size 35/0.06 but without sealer placement. samples grouping and materials used for root canal filling in group 1, ah plus sealer was mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions and applied into the prepared root canal using a lentulo spiral size 25. a master gutta - percha cone of size 35/0.02 was coated with sealer and placed into the root canal to the full working length. lateral condensation was achieved using size 25/0.02 standardized gutta - percha cones and size c finger spreader ( dentsply maillefer ). excess gutta - percha was cut at the orifice level with a flame - heated hand plugger and vertically compacted. in the other experimental groups ( single - cone obturation technique ), the tip of the matched taper cone ( gutta - percha or realseal point ) was dipped into the sealer and placed slowly in up and down motion until reaching the full working length. the coronal excess of the master cone was cut to coronal orifice using a flame - heated hand plugger. in the realseal group, the coronal surface of the obturation was light cured after 5 min for 40 s. all samples were incubated for 1 week at 37c and 95% humidity to allow complete setting of sealers. the roots in the experimental and positive control groups were coated with triple layers of nail varnish, except at the coronal end and apical 1 mm of the root end. microleakage along the root canal was evaluated using the glucose leakage model as described by xu et al. the concentrations of leaked glucose ( mg / dl ) were measured after 1 day and then after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 weeks with a glucose kit ( glucose liquid, quimica clinica applicada s.a ) in a spectrophotometer ( beckman du 520, coulter, germany ) at a wave length of 505 nm. the results were statistically analyzed by kruskal - wallis and mann - whitney tests. to compare leakage at different times within each group, the crowns were cut below the cemento - enamel junction so that the length of roots was standardized at 15 mm. the working length was determined and the canals were instrumented by profile niti rotary instruments ( dentsply maillefer ) to size 35/0.06 using the crown -

whitney test indicated that there was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 throughout the test period. after the 1 week, the lowest glucose leakage was observed in the 4 group. starting from the 3 week onward, the lowest glucose leakage was observed in the groups 3 and 4. comparison between glucose leakage mean values ( mg / dl ) of experimental groups at specific time interval statistical comparisons between glucose leakage values within each group are presented in table 3. there was a progressive and significant increase in the glucose leakage values in all experimental groups ( friedman test, p < 0.05 ). comparison between glucose leakage mean values ( mg / dl ) of different time intervals for each experimental group in the present study, the leakage along root canal fillings was measured by the glucose penetration method, which is simple and could give reliable quantitative leakage measurements. single - rooted teeth with single patent root canals were selected for the current study to minimize variations of canal anatomy. the canal diameter was standardized to iso size 35/06 at apical constriction to have more uniform preparation for most canals. furthermore, the teeth were resected at the cemento - enamel junction to simplify and standardize the instrumentation and obturation procedures. one of the methods previously described for improving the root canal seal is the removal of the smear layer before filling. for this reason, the smear layer was removed in the current study by irrigating the root canals after instrumentation with 17% edta. passive ultrasonic irrigation was used in the current study to enhance the efficacy of the irrigating solutions and smear layer removal. the cold later compaction was used in the current study as a standard to which the other single obturation techniques were compared. the reactivity of obturating materials with glucose could affect the results of the glucose leakage test. the results of this study indicate that all obturation systems allow variable degrees of glucose leakage. the glucose leakage values of ah plus groups either with lateral condensation or single - cone technique were significantly higher at the end of the experimental period. this might be explained by the fast setting and subsequent polymerization shrinkage of ah plus sealer, the lack of bonding between this sealer and gutta - percha, the low penetration ability of this sealer within the dentinal tubules and its hydrophobic property that prevents good adaptation of to the incompletely dried canal. the current results indicated a similar glucose leakage patterns in groups 1 - 3 and showed a progressive increase in glucose concentrations with time. in group 4 ( realseal se ), the glucose leakage pattern was inconsistent throughout experimental periods. after 1 day, no glucose leakage was observed and this may be explained by 5 min delaying the light curing of realseal, which might allow the sealer to flow within the dentinal tubules with a subsequent decrease in the polymerization shrinkage and formation of monoblock. after the 1 week, slight increase of glucose leakage was observed, which became significantly evident after the 2 week. a significant decrease of glucose leakage was observed after the 3 and 4 week which may be due to the expansion of realseal se sealer and resilon by water absorption. after the 6 week, a significant abrupt increase in the glucose leakage was observed again which can be attributed to the higher solubility and bond deterioration of realseal se sealer with time. the glucose leakage of realseal se group was lower than that of groups 1 and 2 at the last 3 weeks. this may be due to the higher flow rate, dual curing and hydrophilicity of realseal se sealer. however, some authors did not find a significant difference between the sealing ability of gutta - percha / ah plus and resilon / epiphany combinations. however, some leakage and push - out studies found that the epoxy resin sealers had better sealability and bond strength. the causes of these differences may be attributed to the method of obturation technique and leakage assessment. the overall lowest mean values for glucose leakage of guttaflow2 group may be attributed to setting expansion, high flow rate and lower solubility of this material. in spite of using different methodologies and obturation techniques, the better sealing ability of guttaflow over ah plus was supported by the finding of a previous study. however, brackett et al. found that the sealing ability of guttaflow / gutta - percha using the single - cone technique and ah plus / gutta - percha using the warm vertical compaction or continuous wave technique was similar. however, some authors found that the sealing ability of ah plus was better than that of guttaflow. within the limitation of this study the following conclusions could be drawn : all obturation techniques used in the current study did not prevent leakage showed a progressive increase in the glucose leakage values over time.root canals filled with matched taper single - cone technique utilizing realseal se or guttaflow2 system allowed the lowest corono - apical glucose penetration with no significant difference between them.matched taper single - cone obturation technique could be an alternative to the cold lateral condensation technique. all obturation techniques used in the current study did not prevent leakage showed a progressive increase in the glucose leakage values over time. root canals filled with matched taper single -

\\n however , pancreatectomy can hasten its onset ( 2 , 3 ) . in another report \\n , six out of seven patients who \\n underwent near - total pancreatectomy had defective linear growth that was mainly caused by \\n impaired insulin secretion , and compared with control children with type 1 diabetes \\n mellitus , the pancreatectomized children showed poorer linear growth ( 10 ) . \\n phhi is a self - limiting disease ; many patients controlled medically without surgery and \\n many of those who remain symptomatic after surgery undergo clinical remission later in \\n childhood . \\n however , previous reports have shown that the response of insulin secretion to \\n glucose and lack of insulin suppressibility are not fully improved even after clinical \\n remission ( 3 , 5 ) . \\n based on these reports , immediate application of subtotal pancreatectomy in cases of phhi \\n should be avoided . \\n screening for the focal or diffuse type of phhi should first be \\n conducted . in the cases of diffuse type \\n , medical control should be attempted before subtotal \\n pancreatectomy . in our case , screening for a focal lesion was not conducted because \\n f - fluoro - l - dopa pet was not available at our facility at that time . medical \\n treatment with diazoxide or octreotide alone was ineffective , and pancreatectomy was planned \\n in order to avoid neurological complications until a cvc was inserted . \\n however , the \\n patient s bg level was successfully controlled by a combined therapy of octreotide and \\n glucose infusion through the cvc , without the need for surgical treatment . \\n clinical remission of \\n hyperinsulinemia was observed with age and was also demonstrated by the results of glucagon \\n stimulation tests . \\n in addition , the result of ogtt after cessation of treatment showed that \\n the patient had a blunted and slightly excessive response , suggesting that she may develop \\n diabetes in the future . this result might be due to the natural course of her disease and \\n might not be the side effect of octreotide because octreotide has a short - lived inhibitory \\n effect on insulin secretion . \\n in fact , long - term inhibition of insulin secretion after \\n cessation of octretide has not been reported . \\n one of the most controversial issues regarding the use of octreotide in children is the \\n growth inhibition caused by suppression of growth - related hormones . in our case , the \\n patient s growth curve remained normal during the 40 mo of octreotide treatment . \\n although \\n more data is needed to assess the risk of growth inhibition from octreotide treatment , there \\n are many case reports demonstrating normal growth rates during octreotide treatment . \\n another complication of combined therapy is the risk of cvc problems , such as occlusion , \\n leakage , or infection . in such cases , \\n it is also very important that the patients and \\n families are able to cope with the injections and appropriate management of the cvc . \\n genetic mutation of the sur gene involving the k- atp channel of  cells has \\n been found in many cases of phhi ( 11,12,13,14,15 ) . in \\n general , mutation of the sur1 gene \\n is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner . on the \\n other hand , loss of the maternal allele of chromosome 11 in the focal lesion and sur1 \\n mutation of the paternal allele \\n have been found in some cases of focal types of phhi ( 16 ) . in our case , \\n mutation from the paternal allele was \\n confirmed , while a rare variant was found in the maternal allele . \\n it is not clear whether \\n this variant is a missence mutation or a rare polymorphism . \\n thus , if the maternal variant is \\n polymorphism , it is possible that the patient had a focal type of phhi or that another sur1 \\n mutation exists in the maternal allele in a region not analyzed . we conclude that combined therapy with a daytime injection of octreotide and nocturnal \\n glucose infusion can be an alternative therapeutic option to subtotal pancreatectomy and \\n that it can allow time to wait for natural remission in patients with phhi .',\n",

       "  'model_output': \"persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (phhi) is characterized by hypoglycemia caused by inappropriate secretion of insulin during the neonatal or infantile period. diazoxide and octreotide have been used for treatment of phhi(1). however, neither is effective in some cases. in cases of phhi resistant to these medical treatments, subtotal pancreatectomy has long been the main solution for avoidance of the neurological complications caused by profound hypoglycemic attack. however, there are many recent reports of long-term complications for it, such as development of diabetes mellitus by adolescence(2,3,4,5). moreover, repeated surgical intervention is required in some cases because of recurrent hypoglycemia(2,3,4,5). on the other hand, spontaneous attenuation of insulin secretion has also been reported during the natural course of phhi(5). this report concerns a case of phhi in which surgical treatment was avoided by combined therapy with subcutaneous injection of octreotide and nocturnal glucose infusion through a central venous catheter (cvc). a female patient, delivered at 40 wk and weighing 4,343 g, was presented with seizure caused by hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia on the day of birth. her blood tests showed no specific findings other than excessive secretion of insulin (insulin 23.4 u/ml, glucose 38 mg/dl, insulin/glucose ratio: 0.62). serum ketones at the time of diagnosis were 24 mol/l for acac and 29 mol/l for 3-ohba. she required continuous glucose infusion (512.5 mg/kg/min) through a percutaneous central venous catheter to maintain a normal blood glucose (bg) level. after developing kawasaki disease at 2 mo of age, her bg level improved transiently and remained stable without any treatment for over a month. however, control of her bg level worsened again and subcutaneous injection of octreotide of up to 21 g/kg/day (6 times a day) was reinitiated at the age of 3 mo. although there was a partial response to octreotide treatment, the bg level remained unstable, and asymptomatic hypoglycemia (under 50 mg/dl) was observed at least two times daily. thus, up to 14 mg/kg/day of diazoxide (3 times a day) was introduced in parallel with octreotide treatment but was discontinued 3 wk later because of an increased frequency of hypoglycemic attack and occurrence of side effects including edema and hirsuties. she was referred to our hospital at the age of 4 mo. at presentation, her height was 69.5 cm (+3.1 sd) and her weight was 8,730 g (+2.7 sd). serum un, creatinine, ast, alt, t-bil and nh3 were 6.0 mg/dl, 0.1 mg/dl, 25 u/l, 13 u/l, 0.3 mg/dl and 49 g/dl, respectively. the results of blood gas analysis for ph, hco3 and be were 7.33, 20.7 meq/l and 4.4 meq/l, respectively. the serum level of tsh, ft3, ft4, gh and cortisol were 3.0 u/ml, 4.35 pg/ml, 1.5 ng/dl, 4.6 ng/ml and 1.3 g/dl, respectively. genetic analysis, which was performed after obtaining informed consent, revealed a compound heterozygote of the sur1 gene, i.e., a nonsense mutation in the paternal allele (exon 25 arg 998stop codon), and an unknown variant in the maternal allele (exon 12 val 560met). as medical treatment with octreotide and diazoxide was ineffective, subtotal pancreatectomy was planned and a cvc was inserted prior to the surgery. constant supply of glucose through the cvc (2.0 mg/kg/min) resulted in normal maintenance of the bg profile with the octreotide treatment (21.0 g/kg/day, 6 times a day). cyclic glucose infusion (3.4 mg/kg/min 16 h) with subcutaneous octreotide injection (14.0 g/kg/day) was subsequently attempted at the age of 6 mo. surgical intervention was aborted because the patient's condition remained stable with this medical treatment for a month. at the age of 7 mo, the daily therapeutic protocol was fixed to injection of octreotide (14.0 g/kg/day) and nocturnal glucose infusion (4.5 mg/kg/min 11 h; fig. 1). three sequential protocols of treatment with octreotide and glucose infusion. the schedule and doses of octreotide injection and glucose infusion described were reduced in a step-by-step manner. the patient's daily profile of bg levels during protocols a to c is shown in fig. 2. daily profile of blood glucose levels before each octreotide injection in protocols a to c. *p<0.05. bg level was measured just before each octreotide injection. the mean monthly values of bg for each protocol are presented in the figure. in protocol a, the mean bg levels for each time of day were 105.0 9.1 mg/dl for 07:00, 85.0 12.2 for 16:00, and 88.0 25.0 for 23:00. in protocol b, they were 101.8 mg/dl 7.8 for 7:00, 93.4 11.2 for 15:00, and 91.9 11.9 for 21:00. in protocol c, they were 84.2 5.8 mg/dl for 7:00, 71.5 12.3 for 17:00, and 86.5 10.2 for 22:00. although there was a statistically significant decrease in bg level between protocols b and c, as shown in fig. 2, the patient did not exhibit hypoglycemia during protocols a to c. the average morning bg level during the month after treatment cessation was stable at 92.4 13.4 mg/dl. daily profile of blood glucose levels before each octreotide injection in protocols a to c. *p<0.05. the results of glucagon stimulation tests for protocols a to c are shown in fig. 3. insulin levels in glucagon stimulation tests for protocols a to c. a dose of 30 g/kg glucagon was intravenously administered 4 h after octreotide injection. the doses of octreotide correspond to each therapeutic protocol. in each protocol, a dose of 30 g/kg glucagon was administered intravenously four hours after octreotide injection. the serum insulin level was measured at 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min after glucagon infusion. the peak levels of the insulin concentration in protocols a to c decreased gradually, and appearance of the peak level was delayed in protocol c compared with those of protocols a and b. as a result, we confirmed that excessive secretion of insulin spontaneously improved during our therapy. insulin levels in glucagon stimulation tests for protocols a to c. a dose of 30 g/kg glucagon was intravenously administered 4 h after octreotide injection. the results of an oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt; 1.75 g/kg glucose) performed 3 mo after cessation of octreotide treatment are shown in table 1. table 1 results of oral glucose tolerance test (1.75 g/kg) 3 mo after treatment cessation. the fasting blood glucose level was normal while the blood glucose levels at 1 and 2 h after glucose administration were 200 mg/dl and 142 mg/dl, respectively, which was defined as impaired glucose tolerance. although the hemoglobin a1c level at that time was 5.1%, which was within the normal range, the results of the ogtt suggest that the patient has the potential to develop diabetes in the future. in phhi, severe hypoglycemia in neonatal or infantile periods can cause irreversible neurological damage. a retrospective study of 90 phhi patients showed that mental retardation existed in 21% of the patients and that epilepsy existed in 18% of the patients(6). another study from germany investigated the long-term outcome of 114 patients with phhi and suggested that psychomotor or mental retardation existed in 44% of the patients and that epilepsy existed in 25% of the patients(4). surgical intervention has been the treatment of choice in many cases of phhi in order to avoid these types of neurological complication. surgical approaches and their outcomes are significantly different between the two histopathological subtypes, diffuse and focal types of phhi. focal types are curable by resection of the focal lesions, while diffuse types require subtotal pancreatectomy if medical treatments are ineffective. in addition, patients still have the potential of recurrent or persistent hypoglycemia even after they receive subtotal pancreatectomy(7). recently, preoperative localization of the focal lesion has been possible by arterial calcium stimulation/venous sampling (asvs), intrahepatic pancreatic portal venous sampling (pvs) or positron emission tomography (pet) using f-fluoro-l-dopa(8,9). among these methods, pet might be the most practical because asvs and pvs are more invasive and less available. subtotal pancreatectomy can result in many long-term complications, such as diabetes mellitus and exocrine failure. because of decreased glucagon reserves, it is more difficult to maintain normoglycemia in such cases than in other types of diabetes mellitus. it has been suggested that many non-operated cases in clinical remission also develop diabetes; however, pancreatectomy can hasten its onset(2,3). in another report, six out of seven patients who underwent near-total pancreatectomy had defective linear growth that was mainly caused by impaired insulin secretion, and compared with control children with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the pancreatectomized children showed poorer linear growth(10). phhi is a self-limiting disease; many patients controlled medically without surgery and many of those who remain symptomatic after surgery undergo clinical remission later in childhood. previous reports have shown that the response of insulin secretion to glucose and lack of insulin suppressibility are not fully improved even after clinical remission(3,5). based on these reports, immediate application of subtotal pancreatectomy in cases of phhi should be avoided. screening for the focal or diffuse type of phhi should first be conducted. in the cases of diffuse type, medical control should be attempted before subtotal pancreatectomy. in our case, screening for a focal lesion was not conducted because f-fluoro-l-dopa pet was not available at our facility at that time. medical treatment with diazoxide or octreotide alone was ineffective, and pancreatectomy was planned in order to avoid neurological complications until a cvc was inserted. however, the patient's bg level was successfully controlled by a combined therapy of octreotide and glucose infusion through the cvc, without the need for surgical treatment. clinical remission of hyperinsulinemia was observed with age and was also demonstrated by the results of glucagon stimulation tests. in addition, the result of ogtt after cessation of treatment showed that the patient had a blunted and slightly excessive response, suggesting that she may develop diabetes in the future. this result might be due to the natural course of her disease and might not be the side effect of octreotide because octreotide has a short-lived inhibitory effect on insulin secretion. in fact, long-term inhibition of insulin secretion after cessation of octretide has not been reported. one of the most controversial issues regarding the use of octreotide in children is the growth inhibition caused by suppression of growth-related hormones. in our case, the patient's growth curve remained normal during the 40 mo of octreotide treatment. although more data is needed to assess the risk of growth inhibition from octreotide treatment, there are many case reports demonstrating normal growth rates during octreotide treatment. another complication of combined therapy is the risk of cvc problems, such as occlusion, leakage, or infection. in such cases, it is also very important that the patients and families are able to cope with the injections and appropriate management of the cvc. genetic mutation of the sur gene involving the k-atp channel of cells has been found in many cases of phhi(11,12,13,14,15). in general, mutation of the sur1 gene is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. on the other hand, loss of the maternal allele of chromosome 11 in the focal lesion and sur1 mutation of the paternal allele have been found in some cases of focal types of phhi(16). in our case, mutation from the paternal allele was confirmed, while a rare variant was found in the maternal allele. it is not clear whether this variant is a missence mutation or a rare polymorphism. thus, if the maternal variant is polymorphism, it is possible that the patient had a focal type of phhi or that another sur1 mutation exists in the maternal allele in a region not analyzed. we conclude that combined therapy with a daytime injection of octreotide and nocturnal glucose infusion can be an alternative therapeutic option to subtotal pancreatectomy and that it can allow time to wait for natural remission in patients with phhi.\"},\n",

       "  'input': \"cancer is the second leading killer in the usa , accounting for 25% of all deaths . \\n prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males , followed by lung and colorectal . for women \\n however , it should be noted that lung cancer is the number one cancer killer for both men and women ( 1 ) . \\n an abundance of evidence suggests that lifestyle factors , including exposure to chemical carcinogens ( smoking , etc . ) , \\n diet and inactivity play a major role in the development of these common cancers . in order to understand how lifestyle changes might reduce the risk for the most common cancers we must first understand how cancer develops . \\n unfortunately , many chemicals in the environment are capable of inducing free radical formation to damage dna in the body . \\n thus , at any given time most , if not all , of us might have a number of pre - neoplastic cells . if we are fortunate , the damaged dna sends a signal to genes such as p53 announcing the damage and increasing the protein products of these genes to stop the pre - neoplastic cell from dividing and hopefully repair the damaged dna . if the repair does not work , the cell should be directed to apoptosis or programmed cell death . since cancer is so common in the usa , \\n this might be the result of defects in the p53 gene or the fact that the gene is suppressed by certain factors . \\n defects in the p53 gene have been identified in about half of all cancers , but these defects are usually observed in end - stage cancer . for prostate cancer \\n all early - stage cancer has an intact p53 gene that is suppressed from acting , as we will discuss later . \\n if the p53 gene does not eliminate the defective pre - neoplastic cell , the cell is stimulated to divide ( promotion stage ) by certain co - carcinogens , leading to the formation of a tumor . \\n thus , to avoid cancer we should try to reduce the initiation stage by reducing exposure to many of the noxious chemical carcinogens present in our environment such as cigarette smoke , pesticides and many other commonly used household products . according to ames ( 2 ) \\n , the typical western diet also contains a variety of mutagens and carcinogens that may act through the generation of oxygen radicals and lead to the initiation of cancer as well as other degenerative diseases . \\n a diet high in fat and/or refined sugar has been shown to induce oxidative stress ( 35 ) . \\n consumption of red meat has been associated with cancers of the colon and rectum , breast and prostate . whether it is the meat itself or the associated fat content is not known . \\n cooking meat at moderate to high temperatures forms carcinogenic heterocyclic amines , shown in animal studies to induce colon , breast and prostate cancer ( 6 ) . \\n conversely , a diet high in whole grains , fruits and vegetables would contain large amounts of natural antioxidants that might play an important role in preventing free radical formation and cancer ( 2 ) . \\n this type of diet has been shown to reduce oxidative stress in the body ( 7 ) . a diet high in whole grains , fruits and vegetables , \\n especially if it includes an abundance of soy products would increase the intake of isoflavones , thought to reduce the risk of cancer ( 8) . \\n genistein , the most abundant isoflavone in soy , has been shown in cell culture experiments to increase p21 and caspase 3 to cause cell cycle arrest and induce apoptosis of tumor cells ( 8) . \\n consumption of soy might explain the large difference in many cancers between western and eastern cultures . \\n another factor that has been suggested to explain the difference is the consumption of green tea by eastern cultures . \\n green tea contains epigallocatechin gallate , also shown to be protective in cell culture and animal studies ( 8) . \\n attention has also been focused on the value of omega-3 fatty acids found primarily in fish and certain nuts and seeds . \\n these fatty acids block cox-2 expression and reduce inflammation that has been implicated in the early stages and/or progression of prostate , breast and colon cancers ( 911 ) . \\n conversely , omega-6 fatty acids found in meat and many vegetable oils increases cox-2 expression . \\n recent studies have shown that non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) that block the cox pathway reduce the development of adenomas , precursors of colon cancer , and reduce the risk for prostate cancer ( 1214 ) . \\n regular exercise has also been shown to increase the body 's antioxidant mechanisms ( 15 ) . \\n in addition to preventing the initiation of cancer , diet and exercise may play an important role in reducing the promotion of cancer and inducing apoptosis by altering hormones such as insulin , testosterone and estrogen or growth factors such as insulin - like growth factor - i ( igf - i ) . \\n the link between smoking and lung cancer was established in the first surgeon general 's report in 1964 . \\n however , a number of epidemiological studies have reported that exercise lowers the risk for lung cancer as reviewed by lee ( 16 ) . \\n the large norwegian study of 81 516 men and women followed for 19 years reported a 25% reduction in lung cancer risk for men who walked or cycled for at least 4  h per week , after controlling for smoking habits and the number of cigarettes smoked ( 17 ) . \\n the mechanism by which exercise might reduce the risk for lung cancer has not been investigated but may be related to the ability of exercise to reduce serum insulin and subsequently igf - i . \\n igf - i has been reported to be a risk factor for lung cancer ( 18 ) . \\n a high consumption of fruit and vegetables has also been associated with a reduced risk for lung cancer ( 19 ) . \\n prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the usa , but has a very low incidence in asia . \\n however , when asian men migrate to the usa and adopt the us lifestyle the incidence of prostate cancer approaches that of us men , suggesting the involvement of lifestyle factors as opposed to a genetic difference ( 20 ) . \\n in addition , as the developing countries with a low incidence of prostate cancer become more westernized , prostate cancer increases ( 21 ) . \\n the two lifestyle factors that have received the most attention are diet , especially the fat content , and being sedentary . \\n the international data show a positive correlation between dietary fat and prostate cancer mortality with the lowest rates found in east asian men and the highest rates found in us and european men ( 22 ) . most of the prospective cohort studies within a given population , however , have failed to show a relationship between dietary fat or fatty food consumption and prostate cancer risk as discussed by moyad ( 23 ) . \\n the negative results from the cohort studies may be due to the fact that in any given population there is little variation in the dietary fat consumption , or may be due to the inability of questionnaires to accurately measure habitual fat consumption . \\n current evidence implicates omega-6 fatty acids in the promotion of cancers and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acids as being protective ( 24 ) . \\n it may also be that in the international data not only do men with a low incidence of prostate cancer mortality consume much lower fat diets , they also tend to be more physically active . \\n epidemiological studies have reported that increased physical activity can reduce the risk for prostate , and other forms of cancer , in us and european men . in a recent review of the literature on physical activity and the risk for prostate cancer , thune and furberg ( 25 ) found that 14 of 28 epidemiological studies reported that increased occupational or leisure - time activity reduced the risk for prostate cancer by 1070% . in order to investigate possible mechanisms involved in the roles that diet and exercise play in the progression of prostate cancer , tymchuk et al . \\n ( 26 ) developed a bioassay using serum to stimulate prostate cancer cells in culture . by placing men on a low - fat diet consisting primarily of grains , \\n fruits and vegetables , and regular , supervised exercise they examined serum changes in vivo and their effect on prostate cancer cell growth in vitro . \\n the subjects were participants or employees from the pritikin longevity center residential program . during their stay at the center , \\n food was prepared and served buffet style to the participants and consisted of 1015% of calories from fat ( polyunsaturated / saturated fatty acid ratio = 1.24 ) , 1520% of calories from protein , and 6575% of calories from carbohydrates , primarily unrefined . \\n carbohydrates were in the form of high - fiber whole grains and other complex carbohydrates ( 5 servings / day ) , vegetables ( 4 servings / day ) , and fruits ( 3 servings / day ) . \\n protein was primarily derived from plant sources with non - fat dairy allowed for up to 2 servings / day . \\n fish or fowl was served in 3.5 ounce portions 1 day / week and in soups or casseroles 2 days / week . \\n the diet contained < 100  mg of cholesterol per day and alcohol , tobacco and caffeinated beverages were not allowed during the program . prior to starting the exercise training , subjects underwent a graded treadmill stress test . \\n based on the results , the subjects were provided with an appropriate training heart rate value and given an individualized walking program . the exercise regimen consisted of daily walking at the training heart rate for 4560  min . in the initial study tymchuk et al . \\n ( 26 ) found that just 11 days of the low - fat diet and exercise program reduced serum - stimulated lncap prostate cancer cell growth by 30% . \\n serum samples obtained from men ( employees ) who had adhered to the low - fat diet and exercise program for an average of 14 years showed an additional 15% reduction in lncap cell growth . \\n lncap is a well - established , androgen - dependent cell line , developed from a patient with prostate cancer . \\n when the serum samples from the men following the low - fat diet and exercise program were used to stimulate pc-3 cells , an androgen - independent cell line typical of advanced prostate cancer , no reduction in cell growth was found ( 26 ) . in a subsequent study ngo et al . \\n ( 27 ) confirmed the diet and exercise reduction in lncap cell growth using another androgen - dependent , patient - derived cell line , lapc-4 . \\n a control group of similar aged men without any intervention were studied over an 11-day period and no change in lncap cell growth was found . in an earlier study tymchuk et al . \\n ( 28 ) had reported that men attending the pritikin longevity center low - fat diet and exercise program had significant reductions in serum insulin and significant elevations in sex hormone - binding globulin . \\n the increase in shbg should lower the serum levels of free testosterone and estradiol , and might be a factor in the reduction in lncap cell growth observed following diet and exercise as this cell line is androgen dependent and has a mutated androgen receptor that binds both testosterone and estradiol . \\n ( 26,29 ) confirmed the reduction in serum free testosterone in the pritikin participants and subsequently reported that insulin , testosterone and estradiol could individually stimulate the growth of lncap cells . \\n however , when these hormones were added individually , or in combination , to the post diet and exercise serum they could only account for half of the reduction in lncap cell growth , indicating the involvement of other important factors . \\n ( 30 ) developed a model similar to figure 2 and started to investigate igf-1 and its binding proteins . \\n the igf axis consists of igf - i , igf - ii , six different binding proteins ( igfbp 16 ) and two receptors , igf - ir and igf - iir . \\n igf - i is a peptide growth factor produced by the liver and other tissues , and is known to play a pivotal role in regulating cell growth , differentiation and apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) ( 18,31 ) . \\n it is also a potent mitogen for most tissues including the prostate ( 18,31 ) . according to yarak et al . \\n igfbp-3 is the most abundant and binds 90% of the circulating igf - i but is not affected by different metabolic states and ngo et al . \\n ( 33 ) found that the low - fat diet and exercise program decreased not only the fasting serum level of insulin , but also igf - i while increasing igfbp-1 . \\n these changes in serum levels of igf - i and igfbp-1 are thought to be due to the changes in serum insulin and its impact on the liver . \\n ( 34 ) reported that insulin stimulated the production of igf - i by hepatocytes . \\n ( 27 ) added igf - i back to the diet and exercise serum , the reduction in lncap cell growth was completely eliminated . \\n when igfbp-1 was added to the baseline serum , they observed a significant reduction in lncap cell growth . \\n in addition to being a regulator of cell growth , igf - i has been reported to be a suppressor of apoptosis in several different studies ( 35 ) . \\n ( 27 ) studied apoptosis in their cell culture system using two different methods , annexin - v and tunel . \\n almost no apoptotic or necrotic cells were found in the fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) control or the pre diet and exercise samples . \\n however , both the annexin - v and tunel staining methods showed a significant increase in apoptosis in the post diet and exercise - serum - stimulated samples . \\n the fact that very little apoptosis was observed in the control serum - stimulated lncap cells may be the result of the high levels of igf - i and low levels of igfbp-1 in the control serum and may help to explain why prostate cancer is so prevalent in the usa . in an attempt to separate out the individual effects of diet versus \\n exercise observed in their earlier studies with the androgen - dependent prostate cancer cell lines , barnard et al . \\n ( 36 ) obtained serum samples from men who had been involved in the adult fitness program at the university of nevada , las vegas . \\n the men were matched in age with a control group of men on no diet or exercise program , and for age and duration of participation to the long - term diet and exercise subjects previously studied . \\n volunteers were requested who had participated in the program for at least 10 years ; the average was 14.7 years . \\n the program was held 5 days per week for 1  h and consisted of warm - up and flexibility activities followed by 4550  min of continuous , strenuous exercise including calisthenics and swimming laps in the pool . \\n serum insulin and igf - i were lower in the exercise and diet + exercise groups compared to controls , but were not significantly different from each other . \\n igfbp-1 was higher in both the exercise and the diet + exercise groups compared to controls and was significantly higher in the diet + exercise group compared to the exercise group . when the serum was used to stimulate the lncap cells in culture , growth was reduced in both the exercise ( 65% fbs control ) and diet + exercise ( 55% fbs control ) groups compared to the control group where the growth was 99% of the fbs . \\n the staining results from the two methods demonstrated that exercise as well as diet and exercise intervention increases apoptosis in the lncap cells . \\n when the slides from the tunel staining were quantitatively analyzed , almost twice as much apoptosis was found in the diet and exercise samples compared to the exercise - only samples . \\n the fact that apoptosis was higher in the diet + exercise subjects is in agreement with the significantly higher igfbp-1 levels compared to the exercise - only group . in an attempt to focus on the possible mechanisms involved in the reduction in lncap cell growth and increased apoptosis observed in the exercise - serum - stimulated samples , leung et al . \\n several studies have shown that igf-1 suppresses the action of p53 that is phosphorylated and stabilized when defects are found in dna . \\n the increase in p53 protein normally activates other genes or factors to cause cell cycle arrest , dna repair or to induce apoptosis ( 34 ) . \\n the serum - stimulated cell cultures were lysed , centrifuged and the supernatant analyzed for p53 protein and was found to be significantly increased in the lysates from the exercise - serum - stimulated lncap cells compared to controls . \\n these results also demonstrate that the lncap cells have an intact p53 pathway that is suppressed with serum from control subjects . according to gurumurthy et al . \\n ( 35 ) an intact p53 pathway is characteristic of all early stage prostate cancer . in end - stage prostate cancer defects \\n have been reported in the p53 gene . to further investigate the involvement of the p53 pathway in the exercise - serum - stimulated lncap cell growth reduction and induction of apoptosis , leung et al . \\n ln-56 is a lncap - derived cell line in which p53 was rendered non - functional by expression of a dominant negative fragment of p53 , known as genetic suppressor element 56 . \\n the results from the growth assay showed no significant difference between the control and exercise groups when the serum was used to stimulate the cells . \\n the exercise - serum - stimulated growth in the ln-56 cells was 91% of the fbs control compared to 65% of fbs control for the lncap cells . \\n when they examined apoptosis in the ln-56 cells , the exercise - serum - stimulated cells showed half the apoptosis observed with the control - serum - stimulated cells . \\n this was opposite to the response observed in the lncap cells where apoptosis was greatly increased in the exercise - serum - stimulated cells . \\n collectively , the results from these experiments indicate that the reduction in serum igf - i and increase in igfbp-1 resulting from adopting a very - low - fat diet and/or regular exercise allows the prostate tumor cells to stabilize the p53 protein and activate downstream effectors to reduce cell growth and induce apoptosis . \\n these data also provide a mechanism to explain the epidemiological data showing a reduction in the risk for prostate cancer in men who take part in regular exercise ( 25 ) . \\n if the observations of reduced cell growth and the induction of apoptosis reported for the cell culture studies with androgen - dependent prostate cancer cell lines also occur in the body , then a very - low - fat diet and exercise program might be of value in the treatment of prostate cancer patients , especially those with early - stage cancer . in order to investigate the possible effectiveness of a very - low - fat diet and exercise program on prostate cancer patients , ornish and colleagues ( 38,39 ) \\n randomized a group of men on  watchful waiting to control or to diet and exercise intervention . \\n the patient all had biopsy - documented prostate cancer , psa ranging from 4 to 10  ng / ml , and a gleason sum of < 7 prostate adenocarcinoma . \\n the men in the diet and exercise intervention group were prescribed a vegan diet with 10% of calories from fat supplemented with soy , 3  g / day fish oil ( omega-3 fatty acid ) and 400  iu / day vitamin e. the exercise was to be aerobic ( walking , jogging etc . ) for 3060  min 6 days / week . \\n patients were also encouraged to practice stress management techniques including yoga , breathing , imagery etc . for 1  h / day . \\n after 1 year , changes in serum psa were small but statistically significant , with the control group showing an increase and the diet and exercise group showing a drop . also , at the end of 1 year , six of 43 in the control group had gone on for conventional treatment due to rising psa while none of the 41 in the diet and exercise group had treatment . \\n there was very high adherence to the diet and exercise program and even some in the control group had made significant lifestyle changes . \\n serum samples from these patients were used in the lncap cell bioassay . compared to baseline , cell growth \\n was reduced by 9% in the control group and by 60% in the diet and exercise group . \\n the growth rate in the baseline samples was not significantly different from what had previously been observed with serum from men without prostate cancer . \\n breast cancer is the most common female cancer in the usa and , like prostate cancer , is hormone - dependent in the early stages . \\n the influence of lifestyle factors in breast cancer is supported by the large international variation and the migration studies ( 40,41 ) . even though breast cancer is initially an estrogen - dependent cancer , \\n most breast cancer occurs in postmenopausal women . with the menopause estrogen levels drop but do not completely disappear as estrogen is produced via aromatase activity , primarily in fat cells . \\n thus , it is not surprising that obesity is a risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer \\n . elevated serum estradiol has also been shown to be a risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women ( 42 ) . like prostate cancer , \\n the international data show a strong , positive correlation between per capita fat consumption and breast cancer incidence and mortality ( 40 ) . \\n epidemiological studies in countries with a high incidence of breast cancer , such as the usa , have shown that regular exercise reduces the risk for breast cancer . in their review , \\n thune and furberg ( 25 ) reported that occupational or leisure time physical activity reduced the risk for breast cancer in 26 of 41 studies by 30% in pre- , peri- and postmenopausal women . in 16 of 28 studies a graded dose \\n heber et al . ( 43 ) studied postmenopausal women attending the pritikin center and reported that the 3-week , low - fat diet and exercise program lowered serum estradiol from 18.1  3.6 to 9.4  2.4  pg / ml . in a subsequent study ( 44 ) \\n they reported serum changes in premenopausal women placed on the pritikin diet for 2 months at the ucla clinical research center . \\n however , serum estradiol was reduced by 25% during the follicular phase and by 22% during the leuteal phase while serum estrone was reduced by 19 and 18% , respectively , during the two phases . \\n shbg , produced primarily in the liver , regulates the amount of free hormone available to interact with the hormone receptors . \\n insulin suppresses the production of shbg by the liver . in a more recent study ( 45 ) with postmenopausal women attending the pritikin 3-week diet and exercise program , \\n serum insulin was reduced by 39% and shbg increased by 39% in women on hormone replacement therapy ( hrt ) . in women not on hrt , insulin was reduced by 19% and shbg increased by 42% . \\n the drop in insulin may be very important as insulin has been reported to be a risk factor for both estrogen positive and negative breast cancer ( 46 ) . \\n barnard rs , liva m , ngo tm , varr bc and hong j ( unpublished ) recently studied changes in the igf axis in postmenopausal women attending the pritikin program . in 18 women on hrt \\n , igf - i was reduced from 170  22 to 142  13  pg / ml and igfbp-1 was increased from 55  8 to 71  10  pg / ml while insulin was reduced from 14.5  2 to 9.1  1  iu / ml . \\n these changes in the igf axis are important as igf - i has been reported to be a risk factor for breast cancer and it is now well established that there is interaction between the igf and estrogen receptor pathways in breast cancer ( 18,47 ) . \\n cancer of the colon and/or rectum is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the usa and is the third most common cancer in both men and women . over the years \\n there has been a lot of controversy regarding the involvement of lifestyle factors in intestinal cancer . \\n this may be due , in part , to different site - specific etiologies of the cancer . like the previous two cancers \\n , colorectal cancer shows a large international variation that armstrong and doll ( 40 ) attributed to the variation in dietary fat consumption . \\n prior to this , burkitt ( 48 ) suggested that other dietary factors such as fiber and refined sugar played a more important role . \\n he suggested that the removal of fiber by refining carbohydrates reduced stool bulk and increased transit time as well as adversely affecting intestional flora . \\n adenomas are precursor lesions of colorectal cancer and are informative endpoints for assessing cancer risk . \\n ( 49 ) showed inverse associations between fiber intake and colorectal adenoma . on the other hand , \\n studies in the usa , finland and sweden reported no protective effect of fiber ( 5052 ) . \\n one large cohort study in us men , the health professionals follow - up study , did find a significant inverse association of distal adenomas and soluble but not insoluble fiber intake ( 53 ) . \\n the exact reason for the inconsistency in the cohort studies is not known but may be due to the fact that the populations have been rather homogeneous with relatively low fiber intakes or may be due to the inability of food questionnaires to accurately predict habitual fiber intake . \\n the recent european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition ( epic ) study involved 519 978 individuals with fiber intakes that ranged from 13  g / day for the lowest quintile to 34  g / day for the highest quintile ( 54 ) . comparing the highest to the lowest quintile of fiber intake they found a relative risk for large bowel cancer of 0.75 . \\n even this intake of 34  g / day was lower that the 50 +  g / day originally described by burkitt . after evaluating the scientific evidence , the european cancer prevention consensus panel concluded in 1998 that there was good evidence to support the protective effect of fiber against colon ( and breast ) cancer ( 55 ) . \\n two recent papers have suggested that hyperinsulinemia resulting from consumption of high - fat , refined - sugar diets may be an important factor in the etiology of colorectal cancer ( 56,57 ) . \\n this might be related to our proposed model for prostate cancer as igf - i has also been found to be a risk factor for colon cancer ( 18 ) . \\n a high - fat diet ( corn oil ) has also been reported to increase colon mucosa igf - i receptors in rats ( 58 ) . \\n the involvement of hyperinsulinemia and elevated igf - i might also be related to the epidemiological studies showing a reduction in intestinal cancer with increased physical activity . according to friedenreich and orenstein ( 59 ) , the most definitive evidence for an association between physical activity and cancer exists for colon cancer . of 51 studies on colon or colorectal cancer , \\n 43 demonstrated a reduction in risk in the most physically active men and women with an average reduction of 4050% and values as high as 70% for the most physically active . \\n ( 60 ) recently examined the relationship between lifestyle factors and p53 mutations in colon tumors . \\n they concluded that a western - style diet high in refined sugar and red meat was correlated with p53 mutations while no association was found with physical activity . \\n this , to our knowledge , is the first study to show a relationship between diet and p53 mutations , whether or not a western - style diet can cause p53 mutations remains to be demonstrated . \\n reddy et al . ( 61 ) studied colon cancer risk factors in eight women attending the pritikin program by collecting stool samples over 2 days and diet records over 3 days before the start and at the end of the 3-week program . \\n dietary fat intake decreased from 34 to 7% of calories and fiber increased from 17 to 37  g / day during the residential program . \\n total stool bile acid was reduced from 9.7  2 to 4.5  1  mg / g dry weight . \\n more important was the very significant reduction in the secondary bile acids , deoxycholic and lithocholic acid that suggests a change in the intestinal flora . \\n the reduction in secondary bile acids should be important as they are thought to be the most carcinogenic bile acids ( 62 ) . \\n intervention trials with bran , soluble fiber or vegetables have not reduced recurrence rates of adenomatous colorectal polyps ( 6365 ) . \\n going back to burkitt 's original work , not only did the african natives have a very low incidence of colorectal cancer with a high fiber intake , they also consumed a very - low - fat diet and were very physically active . \\n thus , it may be that total lifestyle modification is needed to reduce cancer risk , not simply modification of one aspect . \\n in his presidential address to the american cancer society in 1966 , joseph burchenal ( 66 ) suggested that the study of one form of cancer might provide guide - posts to the understanding of another related form of cancer . \\n this suggestion seems to relate to hyperinsulinemia , the igf axis and their associations with several forms of cancer . \\n however , the true unifying factor for most cancers seems to be lifestyle : smoking , a high - fat and refined - sugar diet along with a lack of physical activity . \\n these lifestyle factors can easily be changed and may prevent most types of cancer . by adopting a diet consisting primarily of whole grains , fruits and vegetables with limited amounts of meat , primarily chicken or cold - water fish , and doing 4560  min of daily exercise , one could achieve significant changes in hormones and growth factors known to be associated with cancer as shown in figure 3 . \\n primary prevention trials to test this hypothesis are difficult to conduct due to the large number of subjects , the prolonged time required and the cost . however , secondary prevention trials like the ornish study ( 38,39 ) with prostate cancer or the colorectal adenoma recurrence studies may provide important scientific evidence for the value of these lifestyle changes . \\n a model showing steps in the development of cancer . a model explaining the role of diet and a sedentary lifestyle in the development of prostate cancer [ after barnard et al . \\n a model explaining how a change in lifestyle to include a low - fat , high - fiber diet plus regular exercise might reduce the risk for cancer .\",\n",

       "  'model_output': \"cancer is the second leading killer in the usa, accounting for 25% of all deaths. \\n prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males, followed by lung and colorectal. for women \\n however, it should be noted that lung cancer is the number one cancer killer for both men and women ( 1 ). \\n an abundance of evidence suggests that lifestyle factors, including exposure to chemical carcinogens ( smoking, etc. ), \\n diet and inactivity play a major role in the development of these common cancers. in order to understand how lifestyle changes might reduce the risk for the most common cancers we must first understand how cancer develops. \\n unfortunately, many chemicals in the environment are capable of inducing free radical formation to damage dna in the body. \\n thus, at any given time most, if not all, of us might have a number of pre - neoplastic cells. if we are fortunate, the damaged dna sends a signal to genes such as p53 announcing the damage and increasing the protein products of these genes to stop the pre - neoplastic cell from dividing and hopefully repair the damaged dna. if the repair does not work, the cell should be directed to apoptosis or programmed cell death. since cancer is so common in the usa, \\n this might be the result of defects in the p53 gene or the fact that the gene is suppressed by certain factors. \\n defects in the p53 gene have been identified in about half of all cancers, but these defects are usually observed in end - stage cancer. for prostate cancer \\n all early - stage cancer has an intact p53 gene that is suppressed from acting, as we will discuss later. \\n if the p53 gene does not eliminate the defective pre - neoplastic cell, the cell is stimulated to divide ( promotion stage ) by certain co - carcinogens, leading to the formation of a tumor. \\n thus, to avoid cancer we should try to reduce the initiation stage by reducing exposure to many of the noxious chemical carcinogens present in our environment such as cigarette smoke, pesticides and many other commonly used household products. according to ames ( 2 ) \\n, the typical western diet also contains a variety of mutagens and carcinogens that may act through the generation of oxygen radicals and lead to the initiation of cancer as well as other degenerative diseases. \\n a diet high in fat and/or refined sugar has been shown to induce oxidative stress ( 35 ). \\n consumption of red meat has been associated with cancers of the colon and rectum, breast and prostate. whether it is the meat itself or the associated fat content is not known. \\n cooking meat at moderate to high temperatures forms carcinogenic heterocyclic amines, shown in animal studies to induce colon, breast and prostate cancer ( 6 ). \\n conversely, a diet high in whole grains, fruits and vegetables would contain large amounts of natural antioxidants that might play an important role in preventing free radical formation and cancer ( 2 ). \\n this type of diet has been shown to reduce oxidative stress in the body ( 7 ). a diet high in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, \\n especially if it includes an abundance of soy products would increase the intake of isoflavones, thought to reduce the risk of cancer ( 8). \\n genistein, the most abundant isoflavone in soy, has been shown in cell culture experiments to increase p21 and caspase 3 to cause cell cycle arrest and induce apoptosis of tumor cells ( 8). \\n consumption of soy might explain the large difference in many cancers between western and eastern cultures. \\n another factor that has been suggested to explain the difference is the consumption of green tea by eastern cultures. \\n green tea contains epigallocatechin gallate, also shown to be protective in cell culture and animal studies ( 8). \\n attention has also been focused on the value of omega-3 fatty acids found primarily in fish and certain nuts and seeds. \\n these fatty acids block cox-2 expression and reduce inflammation that has been implicated in the early stages and/or progression of prostate, breast and colon cancers ( 911 ). \\n conversely, omega-6 fatty acids found in meat and many vegetable oils increases cox-2 expression. \\n recent studies have shown that non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) that block the cox pathway reduce the development of adenomas, precursors of colon cancer, and reduce the risk for prostate cancer ( 1214 ). \\n regular exercise has also been shown to increase the body's antioxidant mechanisms ( 15 ). \\n in addition to preventing the initiation of cancer, diet and exercise may play an important role in reducing the promotion of cancer and inducing apoptosis by altering hormones such as insulin, testosterone and estrogen or growth factors such as insulin - like growth factor - i ( igf - i ). \\n the link between smoking and lung cancer was established in the first surgeon general's report in 1964. \\n however, a number of epidemiological studies have reported that exercise lowers the risk for lung cancer as reviewed by lee ( 16 ). \\n the large norwegian study of 81 516 men and women followed for 19 years reported a 25% reduction in lung cancer risk for men who walked or cycled for at least 4  h per week, after controlling for smoking habits and the number of cigarettes smoked ( 17 ). \\n the mechanism by which exercise might reduce the risk for lung cancer has not been investigated but may be related to the ability of exercise to reduce serum insulin and subsequently igf - i. \\n igf - i has been reported to be a risk factor for lung cancer ( 18 ). \\n a high consumption of fruit and vegetables has also been associated with a reduced risk for lung cancer ( 19 ). \\n prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the usa, but has a very low incidence in asia. \\n however, when asian men migrate to the usa and adopt the us lifestyle the incidence of prostate cancer approaches that of us men, suggesting the involvement of lifestyle factors as opposed to a genetic difference ( 20 ). \\n in addition, as the developing countries with a low incidence of prostate cancer become more westernized, prostate cancer increases ( 21 ). \\n the two lifestyle factors that have received the most attention are diet, especially the fat content, and being sedentary. \\n the international data show a positive correlation between dietary fat and prostate cancer mortality with the lowest rates found in east asian men and the highest rates found in us and european men ( 22 ). most of the prospective cohort studies within a given population, however, have failed to show a relationship between dietary fat or fatty food consumption and prostate cancer risk as discussed by moyad ( 23 ). \\n the negative results from the cohort studies may be due to the fact that in any given population there is little variation in the dietary fat consumption, or may be due to the inability of questionnaires to accurately measure habitual fat consumption. \\n current evidence implicates omega-6 fatty acids in the promotion of cancers and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acids as being protective ( 24 ). \\n it may also be that in the international data not only do men with a low incidence of prostate cancer mortality consume much lower fat diets, they also tend to be more physically active. \\n epidemiological studies have reported that increased physical activity can reduce the risk for prostate, and other forms of cancer, in us and european men. in a recent review of the literature on physical activity and the risk for prostate cancer, thune and furberg ( 25 ) found that 14 of 28 epidemiological studies reported that increased occupational or leisure - time activity reduced the risk for prostate cancer by 1070%. in order to investigate possible mechanisms involved in the roles that diet and exercise play in the progression of prostate cancer, tymchuk et al. \\n ( 26 ) developed a bioassay using serum to stimulate prostate cancer cells in culture. by placing men on a low - fat diet consisting primarily of grains, \\n fruits and vegetables, and regular, supervised exercise they examined serum changes in vivo and their effect on prostate cancer cell growth in vitro. \\n the subjects were participants or employees from the pritikin longevity center residential program. during their stay at the center, \\n food was prepared and served buffet style to the participants and consisted of 1015% of calories from fat ( polyunsaturated / saturated fatty acid ratio = 1.24 ), 1520% of calories from protein, and 6575% of calories from carbohydrates, primarily unrefined. \\n carbohydrates were in the form of high - fiber whole grains and other complex carbohydrates ( 5 servings / day ), vegetables ( 4 servings / day ), and fruits ( 3 servings / day ). \\n protein was primarily derived from plant sources with non - fat dairy allowed for up to 2 servings / day. \\n fish or fowl was served in 3.5 ounce portions 1 day / week and in soups or casseroles 2 days / week. \\n the diet contained < 100  mg of cholesterol per day and alcohol, tobacco and caffeinated beverages were not allowed during the program. prior to starting the exercise training, subjects underwent a graded treadmill stress test. \\n based on the results, the subjects were provided with an appropriate training heart rate value and given an individualized walking program. the exercise regimen consisted of daily walking at the training heart rate for 4560  min. in the initial study tymchuk et al. \\n ( 26 ) found that just 11 days of the low - fat diet and exercise program reduced serum - stimulated lncap prostate cancer cell growth by 30%. \\n serum samples obtained from men ( employees ) who had adhered to the low - fat diet and exercise program for an average of 14 years showed an additional 15% reduction in lncap cell growth. \\n lncap is a well - established, androgen - dependent cell line, developed from a patient with prostate cancer. \\n when the serum samples from the men following the low - fat diet and exercise program were used to stimulate pc-3 cells, an androgen - independent cell line typical of advanced prostate cancer, no reduction in cell growth was found ( 26 ). in a subsequent study ngo et al. \\n ( 27 ) confirmed the diet and exercise reduction in lncap cell growth using another androgen - dependent, patient - derived cell line, lapc-4. \\n a control group of similar aged men without any intervention were studied over an 11-day period and no change in lncap cell growth was found. in an earlier study tymchuk et al. \\n ( 28 ) had reported that men attending the pritikin longevity center low - fat diet and exercise program had significant reductions in serum insulin and significant elevations in sex hormone - binding globulin. \\n the increase in shbg should lower the serum levels of free testosterone and estradiol, and might be a factor in the reduction in lncap cell growth observed following diet and exercise as this cell line is androgen dependent and has a mutated androgen receptor that binds both testosterone and estradiol. \\n ( 26,29 ) confirmed the reduction in serum free testosterone in the pritikin participants and subsequently reported that insulin, testosterone and estradiol could individually stimulate the growth of lncap cells. \\n however, when these hormones were added individually, or in combination, to the post diet and exercise serum they could only account for half of the reduction in lncap cell growth, indicating the involvement of other important factors. \\n ( 30 ) developed a model similar to figure 2 and started to investigate igf-1 and its binding proteins. \\n the igf axis consists of igf - i, igf - ii, six different binding proteins ( igfbp 16 ) and two receptors, igf - ir and igf - iir. \\n igf - i is a peptide growth factor produced by the liver and other tissues, and is known to play a pivotal role in regulating cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) ( 18,31 ). \\n it is also a potent mitogen for most tissues including the prostate ( 18,31 ). according to yarak et al. \\n igfbp-3 is the most abundant and binds 90% of the circulating igf - i but is not affected by different metabolic states and ngo et al. \\n ( 33 ) found that the low - fat diet and exercise program decreased not only the fasting serum level of insulin, but also igf - i while increasing igfbp-1. \\n these changes in serum levels of igf - i and igfbp-1 are thought to be due to the changes in serum insulin and its impact on the liver. \\n ( 34 ) reported that insulin stimulated the production of igf - i by hepatocytes. \\n ( 27 ) added igf - i back to the diet and exercise serum, the reduction in lncap cell growth was completely eliminated. \\n when igfbp-1 was added to the baseline serum, they observed a significant reduction in lncap cell growth. \\n in addition to being a regulator of cell growth, igf - i has been reported to be a suppressor of apoptosis in several different studies ( 35 ). \\n ( 27 ) studied apoptosis in their cell culture system using two different methods, annexin - v and tunel. \\n almost no apoptotic or necrotic cells were found in the fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) control or the pre diet and exercise samples. \\n however, both the annexin - v and tunel staining methods showed a significant increase in apoptosis in the post diet and exercise - serum - stimulated samples. \\n the fact that very little apoptosis was observed in the control serum - stimulated lncap cells may be the result of the high levels of igf - i and low levels of igfbp-1 in the control serum and may help to explain why prostate cancer is so prevalent in the usa. in an attempt to separate out the individual effects of diet versus \\n exercise observed in their earlier studies with the androgen - dependent prostate cancer cell lines, barnard et al. \\n ( 36 ) obtained serum samples from men who had been involved in the adult fitness program at the university of nevada, las vegas. \\n the men were matched in age with a control group of men on no diet or exercise program, and for age and duration of participation to the long - term diet and exercise subjects previously studied. \\n volunteers were requested who had participated in the program for at least 10 years ; the average was 14.7 years. \\n the program was held 5 days per week for 1  h and consisted of warm - up and flexibility activities followed by 4550  min of continuous, strenuous exercise including calisthenics and swimming laps in the pool. \\n serum insulin and igf - i were lower in the exercise and diet + exercise groups compared to controls, but were not significantly different from each other. \\n igfbp-1 was higher in both the exercise and the diet + exercise groups compared to controls and was significantly higher in the diet + exercise group compared to the exercise group. when the serum was used to stimulate the lncap cells in culture, growth was reduced in both the exercise ( 65% fbs control ) and diet + exercise ( 55% fbs control ) groups compared to the control group where the growth was 99% of the fbs. \\n the staining results from the two methods demonstrated that exercise as well as diet and exercise intervention increases apoptosis in the lncap cells. \\n when the slides from the tunel staining were quantitatively analyzed, almost twice as much apoptosis was found in the diet and exercise samples compared to the exercise - only samples. \\n the fact that apoptosis was higher in the diet + exercise subjects is in agreement with the significantly higher igfbp-1 levels compared to the exercise - only group. in an attempt to focus on the possible mechanisms involved in the reduction in lncap cell growth and increased apoptosis observed in the exercise - serum - stimulated samples, leung et al. \\n several studies have shown that igf-1 suppresses the action of p53 that is phosphorylated and stabilized when defects are found in dna. \\n the increase in p53 protein normally activates other genes or factors to cause cell cycle arrest, dna repair or to induce apoptosis ( 34 ). \\n the serum - stimulated cell cultures were lysed, centrifuged and the supernatant analyzed for p53 protein and was found to be significantly increased in the lysates from the exercise - serum - stimulated lncap cells compared to controls. \\n these results also demonstrate that the lncap cells have an intact p53 pathway that is suppressed with serum from control subjects. according to gurumurthy et al. \\n ( 35 ) an intact p53 pathway is characteristic of all early stage prostate cancer. in end - stage prostate cancer defects \\n have been reported in the p53 gene. to further investigate the involvement of the p53 pathway in the exercise - serum - stimulated lncap cell growth reduction and induction of apoptosis, leung et al. \\n ln-56 is a lncap - derived cell line in which p53 was rendered non - functional by expression of a dominant negative fragment of p53, known as genetic suppressor element 56. \\n the results from the growth assay showed no significant difference between the control and exercise groups when the serum was used to stimulate the cells. \\n the exercise - serum - stimulated growth in the ln-56 cells was 91% of the fbs control compared to 65% of fbs control for the lncap cells. \\n when they examined apoptosis in the ln-56 cells, the exercise - serum - stimulated cells showed half the apoptosis observed with the control - serum - stimulated cells. \\n this was opposite to the response observed in the lncap cells where apoptosis was greatly increased in the exercise - serum - stimulated cells. \\n collectively, the results from these experiments indicate that the reduction in serum igf - i and increase in igfbp-1 resulting from adopting a very - low - fat diet and/or regular exercise allows the prostate tumor cells to stabilize the p53 protein and activate downstream effectors to reduce cell growth and induce apoptosis. \\n these data also provide a mechanism to explain the epidemiological data showing a reduction in the risk for prostate cancer in men who take part in regular exercise ( 25 ). \\n if the observations of reduced cell growth and the induction of apoptosis reported for the cell culture studies with androgen - dependent prostate cancer cell lines also occur in the body, then a very - low - fat diet and exercise program might be of value in the treatment of prostate cancer patients, especially those with early - stage cancer. in order to investigate the possible effectiveness of a very - low - fat diet and exercise program on prostate cancer patients, ornish and colleagues ( 38,39 ) \\n randomized a group of men on  watchful waiting to control or to diet and exercise intervention. \\n the patient all had biopsy - documented prostate cancer, psa ranging from 4 to 10  ng / ml, and a gleason sum of < 7 prostate adenocarcinoma. \\n the men in the diet and exercise intervention group were prescribed a vegan diet with 10% of calories from fat supplemented with soy, 3  g / day fish oil ( omega-3 fatty acid ) and 400  iu / day vitamin e. the exercise was to be aerobic ( walking, jogging etc. ) for 3060  min 6 days / week. \\n patients were also encouraged to practice stress management techniques including yoga, breathing, imagery etc. for 1  h / day. \\n after 1 year, changes in serum psa were small but statistically significant, with the control group showing an increase and the diet and exercise group showing a drop. also, at the end of 1 year, six of 43 in the control group had gone on for conventional treatment due to rising psa while none of the 41 in the diet and exercise group had treatment. \\n there was very high adherence to the diet and exercise program and even some in the control group had made significant lifestyle changes. \\n serum samples from these patients were used in the lncap cell bioassay. compared to baseline, cell growth \\n was reduced by 9% in the control group and by 60% in the diet and exercise group. \\n the growth rate in the baseline samples was not significantly different from what had previously been observed with serum from men without prostate cancer. \\n breast cancer is the most common female cancer in the usa and, like prostate cancer, is hormone - dependent in the early stages. \\n the influence of lifestyle factors in breast cancer is supported by the large international variation and the migration studies ( 40,41 ). even though breast cancer is initially an estrogen - dependent cancer, \\n most breast cancer occurs in postmenopausal women. with the menopause estrogen levels drop but do not completely disappear as estrogen is produced via aromatase activity, primarily in fat cells. \\n thus, it is not surprising that obesity is a risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer \\n. elevated serum estradiol has also been shown to be a risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women ( 42 ). like prostate cancer, \\n the international data show a strong, positive correlation between per capita fat consumption and breast cancer incidence and mortality ( 40 ). \\n epidemiological studies in countries with a high incidence of breast cancer, such as the usa, have shown that regular exercise reduces the risk for breast cancer. in their review, \\n thune and furberg ( 25 ) reported that occupational or leisure time physical activity reduced the risk for breast cancer in 26 of 41 studies by 30% in pre-, peri- and postmenopausal women. in 16 of 28 studies a graded dose \\n heber et al. ( 43 ) studied postmenopausal women attending the pritikin center and reported that the 3-week, low - fat diet and exercise program lowered serum estradiol from 18.1  3.6 to 9.4  2.4  pg / ml. in a subsequent study ( 44 ) \\n they reported serum changes in premenopausal women placed on the pritikin diet for 2 months at the ucla clinical research center. \\n however, serum estradiol was reduced by 25% during the follicular phase and by 22% during the leuteal phase while serum estrone was reduced by 19 and 18%, respectively, during the two phases. \\n shbg, produced primarily in the liver, regulates the amount of free hormone available to interact with the hormone receptors. \\n insulin suppresses the production of shbg by the liver. in a more recent study ( 45 ) with postmenopausal women attending the pritikin 3-week diet and exercise program, \\n serum insulin was reduced by 39% and shbg increased by 39% in women on hormone replacement therapy ( hrt ). in women not on hrt, insulin was reduced by 19% and shbg increased by 42%. \\n the drop in insulin may be very important as insulin has been reported to be a risk factor for both estrogen positive and negative breast cancer ( 46 ). \\n barnard rs, liva m, ngo tm, varr bc and hong j ( unpublished ) recently studied changes in the igf axis in postmenopausal women attending the pritikin program. in 18 women on hrt \\n, igf - i was reduced from 170  22 to 142  13  pg / ml and igfbp-1 was increased from 55  8 to 71  10  pg / ml while insulin was reduced from 14.5  2 to 9.1  1  iu / ml. \\n these changes in the igf axis are important as igf - i has been reported to be a risk factor for breast cancer and it is now well established that there is interaction between the igf and estrogen receptor pathways in breast cancer ( 18,47 ). \\n cancer of the colon and/or rectum is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the usa and is the third most common cancer in both men and women. over the years \\n there has been a lot of controversy regarding the involvement of lifestyle factors in intestinal cancer. \\n this may be due, in part, to different site - specific etiologies of the cancer. like the previous two cancers \\n, colorectal cancer shows a large international variation that armstrong and doll ( 40 ) attributed to the variation in dietary fat consumption. \\n prior to this, burkitt ( 48 ) suggested that other dietary factors such as fiber and refined sugar played a more important role. \\n he suggested that the removal of fiber by refining carbohydrates reduced stool bulk and increased transit time as well as adversely affecting intestional flora. \\n adenomas are precursor lesions of colorectal cancer and are informative endpoints for assessing cancer risk. \\n ( 49 ) showed inverse associations between fiber intake and colorectal adenoma. on the other hand, \\n studies in the usa, finland and sweden reported no protective effect of fiber ( 5052 ). \\n one large cohort study in us men, the health professionals follow - up study, did find a significant inverse association of distal adenomas and soluble but not insoluble fiber intake ( 53 ). \\n the exact reason for the inconsistency in the cohort studies is not known but may be due to the fact that the populations have been rather homogeneous with relatively low fiber intakes or may be due to the inability of food questionnaires to accurately predict habitual fiber intake. \\n the recent european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition ( epic ) study involved 519 978 individuals with fiber intakes that ranged from 13  g / day for the lowest quintile to 34  g / day for the highest quintile ( 54 ). comparing the highest to the lowest quintile of fiber intake they found a relative risk for large bowel cancer of 0.75. \\n even this intake of 34  g / day was lower that the 50 +  g / day originally described by burkitt. after evaluating the scientific evidence, the european cancer prevention consensus panel concluded in 1998 that there was good evidence to support the protective effect of fiber against colon ( and breast ) cancer ( 55 ). \\n two recent papers have suggested that hyperinsulinemia resulting from consumption of high - fat, refined - sugar diets may be an important factor in the etiology of colorectal cancer ( 56,57 ). \\n this might be related to our proposed model for prostate cancer as igf - i has also been found to be a risk factor for colon cancer ( 18 ). \\n a high - fat diet ( corn oil ) has also been reported to increase colon mucosa igf - i receptors in rats ( 58 ). \\n the involvement of hyperinsulinemia and elevated igf - i might also be related to the epidemiological studies showing a reduction in intestinal cancer with increased physical activity. according to friedenreich and orenstein ( 59 ), the most definitive evidence for an association between physical activity and cancer exists for colon cancer. of 51 studies on colon or colorectal cancer, \\n 43 demonstrated a reduction in risk in the most physically active men and women with an average reduction of 4050% and values as high as 70% for the most physically active. \\n ( 60 ) recently examined the relationship between lifestyle factors and p53 mutations in colon tumors. \\n they concluded that a western - style diet high in refined sugar and red meat was correlated with p53 mutations while no association was found with physical activity. \\n this, to our knowledge, is the first study to show a relationship between diet and p53 mutations, whether or not a western - style diet can cause p53 mutations remains to be demonstrated. \\n reddy et al. ( 61 ) studied colon cancer risk factors in eight women attending the pritikin program by collecting stool samples over 2 days and diet records over 3 days before the start and at the end of the 3-week program. \\n dietary fat intake decreased from 34 to 7% of calories and fiber increased from 17 to 37  g / day during the residential program. \\n total stool bile acid was reduced from 9.7  2 to 4.5  1  mg / g dry weight. \\n more important was the very significant reduction in the secondary bile acids, deoxycholic and lithocholic acid that suggests a change in the intestinal flora. \\n the reduction in secondary bile acids should be important as they are thought to be the most carcinogenic bile acids ( 62 ). \\n intervention trials with bran, soluble fiber or vegetables have not reduced recurrence rates of adenomatous colorectal polyps ( 6365 ). \\n going back to burkitt's original work, not only did the african natives have a very low incidence of colorectal cancer with a high fiber intake, they also consumed a very - low - fat diet and were very physically active. \\n thus, it may be that total lifestyle modification is needed to reduce cancer risk, not simply modification of one aspect. \\n in his presidential address to the american cancer society in 1966, joseph burchenal ( 66 ) suggested that the study of one form of cancer might provide guide - posts to the understanding of another related form of cancer. \\n this suggestion seems to relate to hyperinsulinemia, the igf axis and their associations with several forms of cancer. \\n however, the true unifying factor for most cancers seems to be lifestyle : smoking, a high - fat and refined - sugar diet along with a lack of physical activity. \\n these lifestyle factors can easily be changed and may prevent most types of cancer. by adopting a diet consisting primarily of whole grains, fruits and vegetables with limited amounts of meat, primarily chicken or cold - water fish, and doing 4560  min of daily exercise, one could achieve significant changes in hormones and growth factors known to be associated with cancer as shown in figure 3. \\n primary prevention trials to test this hypothesis are difficult to conduct due to the large number of subjects, the prolonged time required and the cost. however, secondary prevention trials like the ornish study ( 38,39 ) with prostate cancer or the colorectal adenoma recurrence studies may provide important scientific evidence for the value of these lifestyle changes. \\n a model showing steps in the development of cancer. a model explaining the role of diet and a sedentary lifestyle in the development of prostate cancer [ after barnard et al. \\n a model explaining how a change in lifestyle to include a low - fat, high - fiber diet plus regular exercise might reduce the risk for cancer.\"},\n",

       "  'input': 'the exact detection and determination of proteins , nucleic acids , and sugars in a single cell are a romantic vision of modern biology and medical sciences . \\n even though a tissue consists of apparently similar cells , which belong to , for example , the same organ lobe , the same nerve nucleus , and even the same carcinomatous lesion , each of these cells has its own individuality and demonstrates various , complicated , and uneven responses . as we scientists secretly imagine , this individuality seems to create the complexity and magnificence of life . \\n realistically , however , we have so far been obliged to report data on the optical density of bands obtained by southern , northern , and western blotting , in which a lot of cells are employed . \\n sometimes  single - cell - level amounts are calculated from many single cells after division by the number of cells . \\n needless to say , this practice occurs because it is too difficult to detect and determine the molecules in an actual single cell . \\n in this situation , trace amounts of nucleic acids have been made detectable by the invention of polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) by mullis . \\n then , in the 1990s , the emergence of real - time pcr enabled us to determine the copy numbers of nucleic acids . \\n various derivative methods of real - time pcr are now applicable to cells and tissues , and in particular quantitative real - time pcr can detect the copy number , such as a few copies , of nucleic acids in a single cell . \\n although quantitative real - time pcr is not always suitable for a comprehensive analysis of gene expression , dna microarray analysis can be used instead of pcr to examine nucleic acids for this purpose . \\n for example , gene expression at the mrna level can be easily examined if the sensitivity is allowed to be limited . \\n more recently , digital pcr has been proposed as a new approach to the detection and quantification for nucleic acids . \\n real - time pcr carries out one reaction per single sample , whereas digital pcr also carries out a single reaction within a sample , however the sample is separated into a large number of partitions and the reaction is carried out in each partition individually . \\n some portions of these reactions contain the target molecule ( positive ) while others do not ( negative ) . \\n following pcr analysis , the fraction of negative reactions is used to generate an absolute count of the number of target molecules in the sample , without reference to standards or endogenous controls . \\n the digital pcr can be routinely used for clonal amplification of samples for next - generation sequencing . to sum up \\n , almost all the analyses for nucleic acids can be performed at present using commercially available methods , ranging from a simultaneous and comprehensive analysis of multiple nucleic acids of cells and tissues to a precise analysis of a specific gene in a single cell . on the other hand \\n , a change in the amount of mrnas in a cell does not always correspond to a change in the amount of translated proteins . \\n that is , we have to accept that a quantitative analysis of nucleic acids offers important knowledge but does not conclude precisely the phenomenon of gene expression . \\n thus , we have to attempt to measure the amount of proteins , possibly at a single - cell level . in the present study \\n , we introduce a de novo method we developed to measure trace amounts of proteins at a single - cell level . \\n this highly sensitive detection method also helps to facilitate single - level studies in biological and medical fields . \\n for example , single - cell metabolism has been vigorously examined , particularly for neurons and glia . because metabolism is usually expressed as the sum of chemical processes that occur in living organisms , the data obtained from a single cell should be accumulated and analyzed to gain a better understanding of metabolism . \\n many attempts , including lab - on - a - chip studies , have been performed thus far to detect trace amounts of proteins in a single cell . \\n although some of these studies have achieved the ultimate sensitivity , they must employ specialized and expensive apparatuses for the experiments . \\n thus we decided to develop a system with special attention paid to  versatility and  user - friendliness. among the various techniques to quantify trace amounts of proteins , a \\n sandwich enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) may be the most versatile and user - friendly . \\n elisa is an easy , rapid , specific , and highly sensitive detection method and thus has been widely used in biology and clinical medicine . \\n for example , the limits of detection in the elisa for insulin established in the 1980s and 1990s were on the order of iu / ml , which corresponded to 10 moles / ml . so what should we do ? \\n a cycling reaction is conducted by a dehydrogenase such as 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( 3-hsd , ec . \\n 3-hsd catalyzes substrate cycling between 3-hydroxysteroid and its corresponding 3-ketosteroid in the presence of an excess amount of nadh and thionicotinamide - adenine dinucleotide ( thio - nad ) , because 3-hsd utilizes both nadh and thio - nad as cofactors . in each turn of the cycle , one molecule of thio - nad \\n thio - nadh has the absorbance at 400  nm ( 11900  m cm ) . \\n the other cofactors of 3-hsd , such as thio - nad , nad , and nadh , have the absorbance maximums under 340  nm . \\n therefore , the amount of thio - nadh can be measured with a commercially available microplate reader with a 405  nm filter . \\n these features make it possible to determine the amounts of 3-hydroxysteroids with high sensitivity by measuring the cumulative quantity of thio - nadh . \\n we call this enzyme cycling thio - nad cycling . the combination of a sandwich elisa and a thio - nad cycling method gives us an ultrasensitive detection of trace amounts of proteins ( figure  1 ) . in our sandwich elisa , we use 17-methoxy-5-androstan-3-ol 3-phosphate as a synthetic substrate for alkaline phosphatase ( alp , ec . \\n 3.1.3.1 ) linked to a secondary antibody , because 17-methoxy-5-androstan-3-ol 3-phosphate is easily hydrolyzed by alp to 17-methoxy-5-androstan-3-ol , which shows highly efficient thio - nad cycling . \\n 17-methoxy-5-androstan-3-ol is then oxidized to 17-methoxy-5-androstan-3-one under a catalytic reaction of 3-hsd with the cofactor thio - nad . by the opposite reaction , \\n the detectable signal changes linearly against a measuring time ; in thio - nad cycling , the detectable signal also changes linearly against the measurement time . in the combination , however , the detectable signal , i.e. , thio - nadh , accumulates in a quadratic function - like fashion during the cycling reaction within a short measurement time . \\n figure 1.scheme of ultrasensitive detection of proteins by elisa coupled with thio - nad cycling . \\n our ultrasensitive elisa requires only the addition of a thio - nad cycling solution , which includes androsterone derivatives , and 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and its coenzymes , to the usual elisa without any use of special instruments . \\n absorption ( 400  nm ) of thio - nadh is measured with a commercially available microplate reader . \\n our ultrasensitive elisa requires only the addition of a thio - nad cycling solution , which includes androsterone derivatives , and 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and its coenzymes , to the usual elisa without any use of special instruments . \\n absorption ( 400  nm ) of thio - nadh is measured with a commercially available microplate reader . \\n more specifically , because the thio - nadh signaling intensity depends on the number of thio - nadh molecules accumulated by the enzyme reactions , the thio - nadh signaling intensity a  xb   xk=1nk  =  a  xb  xn(n+1)2 . here , a is the turnover ratio of alp per min ; b is the cycling ratio of 3-hsd per min ; and n = min of measurement time . \\n the amount of insulin was calculated from the increase in absorbance at 405  nm . \\n the claim for our novel method is that proteins themselves can not be amplified , but a detectable signal for proteins can be amplified by means of a quadratic function - like response ( i.e. , triangular number ) . \\n our ultrasensitive elisa coupled with thio - nad cycling needs only a detection apparatus for absorbance at 405  nm , but does not need any specialized apparatus , specialized laboratory , or use of radio isotopes and fluorescent probes . \\n for an analysis at the single - cell level , we attempted to detect proteins at 10 moles / assay . \\n we applied our ultrasensitive elisa coupled with thio - nad cycling to the detection of human proteins , such as insulin , hiv-1 ( human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ) p24 , and adiponectin . \\n insulin is a peptide hormone produced by  cells in the pancreas , and it regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats by promoting the absorption of glucose from the blood to skeletal muscles and fat tissue . \\n the limit of detection for insulin with our ultrasensitive elisa was 8.0  10 moles / assay ( 0.0047 pg / assay ) with the linear calibration curve of 8.9  10  8.9  10 moles / assay in tris - buffered saline ; the coefficient of variation was 4% for 8.9  10 moles / assay . \\n because of this ultra - high sensitivity , only 5  l of serum was needed . \\n further , a comparison between the data obtained from a commercially available immunoreactive insulin kit ( i.e. , a conventional elisa ) and the data obtained from our ultrasensitive elisa using the same commercially available reference demonstrated that the correlation was very good , providing further evidence that our assay is also accurate in blood samples . \\n hiv is a lentivirus that causes hiv infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( aids ) . \\n hiv infection occurs by the transfer of blood , semen , vaginal fluid , breast milk , and so on . to reduce the window period between hiv-1 infection and the ability to diagnose it , a fourth - generation immunoassay including the detection of a viral protein , hiv-1 p24 , has been developed . \\n our ultrasensitive elisa enabled us to detect p24 at 2.3  10 moles / assay ( 0.0055 iu / assay ) as the limit of detection . \\n the linear calibration curves were obtained in the range of 2.1  10  2.1  10 moles / assay . \\n the spike - and - recovery tests were performed in which the hiv-1 p24 antigen was added into the control serum . \\n the results demonstrated that the ratio was about 100% for 1.0  10 moles / assay ( 0.5 iu / ml ) of hiv-1 p24 , which was less than the value ( 2 iu / ml ) required for a ce - marked hiv antigen / antibody assay . \\n thus , our ultrasensitive method is able to detect hiv-1 p24 antigen in human blood obtained from patients in the very early period after infection . \\n briefly , we explain the spike - and - recovery test . the spike - and - recovery test is a technique for analyzing and accessing the accuracy of elisa for particular sample types , such as serum , plasma , saliva , urine , etc . \\n it is used to determine whether analyte detection can be affected by the difference between the diluent used for preparation and the experimental sample matrix . to perform a spike - and - recovery test \\n , a known amount of analyte ( i.e. , target protein in our case ) is added to a matrix ( i.e. , blood or urine in our case ) . \\n spike. the concentration of the added analyte in the matrix is determined from standard curves prepared . \\n adiponectin is a protein hormone that modulates a number of metabolic processes , including glucose regulation and fatty acid oxidation . \\n adiponectin is exclusively secreted from adipose tissue into the bloodstream and is very abundant in plasma relative to many hormones . \\n however , the patterns of change in urinary adiponectin levels in various diseases remain unknown , because the urinary adiponectin levels are thought to be extremely low . \\n spike - and - recovery tests using urine confirmed the reliability of our ultrasensitive elisa . \\n the limit of detection for adiponectin was 2.3  10 moles / assay ( 0.069 pg / assay ) with a linear calibration curve of 4.2  10  1.7  10 moles / assay . \\n the coefficient of variation was 4% for 1.7  10 moles / assay of adiponectin . \\n the pilot study showed that the urinary adiponectin levels , which were corrected by the creatinine concentration , were higher in diabetes mellitus patients than in healthy subjects . \\n further , these urinary adiponectin levels tended to increase with the progression of diabetes mellitus accompanied by nephropathy . \\n glucose is transported from the intestines or liver to bodily cells via the bloodstream , and is made available for cell absorption via the hormone insulin , produced primarily in the pancreas . \\n recently , the examination of single - cell metabolism has begun , particularly in the brain , and thus a highly sensitive measurement of sugars is also needed for this purpose . \\n glucose oxidase ( god ) reduces oxygen o2 to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the presence of glucose . \\n this reaction occurs in a glucose dose -

       "  'model_output': 'the exact detection and determination of proteins, nucleic acids, and sugars in a single cell are a romantic vision of modern biology and medical sciences. even though a tissue consists of apparently similar cells, which belong to, for example, the same organ lobe, the same nerve nucleus, and even the same carcinomatous lesion, each of these cells has its own individuality and demonstrates various, complicated, and uneven responses. as we scientists secretly imagine, this individuality seems to create the complexity and magnificence of life. realistically, however, we have so far been obliged to report data on the optical density of bands obtained by southern, northern, and western blotting, in which a lot of cells are employed. sometimes single - cell - level amounts are calculated from many single cells after division by the number of cells. needless to say, this practice occurs because it is too difficult to detect and determine the molecules in an actual single cell. so what should we do? a cycling reaction is conducted by a dehydrogenase such as 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( 3-hsd, ec. 3-hsd catalyzes substrate cycling between 3-hydroxysteroid and its corresponding 3-ketosteroid in the presence of an excess amount of nadh and thionicotinamide - adenine dinucleotide ( thio - nad ), because 3-hsd utilizes both nadh and thio - nad as cofactors. in each turn of the cycle, one molecule of thio - nad thio - nadh has the absorbance at 400  nm ( 11900  m cm ). the other cofactors of 3-hsd, such as thio - nad, nad, and nadh, have the absorbance maximums under 340  nm. therefore, the amount of thio - nadh can be measured with a commercially available microplate reader with a 405  nm filter. these features make it possible to determine the amounts of 3-hydroxysteroids with high sensitivity by measuring the cumulative quantity of thio - nadh. we call this enzyme cycling thio - nad cycling. the combination of a sandwich elisa and a thio - nad cycling method gives us an ultrasensitive detection of trace amounts of proteins ( figure  1 ). in our sandwich elisa, we use 17-methoxy-5-androstan-3-ol 3-phosphate as a synthetic substrate for alkaline phosphatase ( alp, ec. 17-methoxy-5-androstan-3-ol is then oxidized to 17-methoxy-5-androstan-3-one under a catalytic reaction of 3-hsd with the cofactor thio - nad. by the opposite reaction, the detectable signal changes linearly against a measuring time ; in thio - nad cycling, the detectable signal also changes linearly against the measurement time. in the combination, however, the detectable signal, i.e., thio - nadh, accumulates in a quadratic function - like fashion during the cycling reaction within a short measurement time. our ultrasensitive elisa coupled with thio - nad cycling needs only a detection apparatus for absorbance at 405  nm, but does not need any specialized apparatus, specialized laboratory, or use of radio isotopes and fluorescent probes. for an analysis at the single - cell level, we attempted to detect proteins at 10 moles / assay. we applied our ultrasensitive elisa coupled with thio - nad cycling to the detection of human proteins, such as insulin, hiv-1 ( human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ) p24, and adiponectin. insulin is a peptide hormone produced by  cells in the pancreas, and it regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats by promoting the absorption of glucose from the blood to skeletal muscles and fat tissue. the limit of detection for insulin with our ultrasensitive elisa was 8.0  10 moles / assay ( 0.0047 pg / assay ) with the linear calibration curve of 8.9  10 moles / assay in tris - buffered saline ; the coefficient of variation was 4% for 8.9  10 moles / assay. because of this ultra - high sensitivity, only 5  l of serum was needed. further, a comparison between the data obtained from a commercially available immunoreactive insulin kit ( i.e., a conventional elisa ) and the data obtained from our ultrasensitive elisa using the same commercially available reference demonstrated that the correlation was very good, providing further evidence that our assay is also accurate in blood samples. hiv is a lentivirus that causes hiv infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( aids ). hiv infection occurs by the transfer of blood, semen, vaginal fluid, breast milk, and so on. to reduce the window period between hiv-1 infection and the ability to diagnose it, a fourth - generation immunoassay including the detection of a viral protein, hiv-1 p24, has been developed. our ultrasensitive elisa enabled us to detect p24 at 2.3  10 moles / assay ( 0.0055 iu / assay ) as the limit of detection. the linear calibration curves were obtained in the range of 2.1  10 moles / assay. the spike - and - recovery tests were performed in which the hiv-1 p24 antigen was added into the control serum. the results demonstrated that the ratio was about 100% for 1.0  10 moles / assay ( 0.5 iu / ml ) of hiv-1 p24, which was less than the value ( 2 iu / ml ) required for a ce - marked hiv antigen / antibody assay. thus, our ultrasensitive method is able to detect hiv-1 p24 antigen in human blood obtained from patients in the very early period after infection. briefly, we explain the spike - and - recovery test. the spike - and - recovery test is a technique for analyzing and accessing the accuracy of elisa for particular sample types, such as serum, plasma, saliva, urine, etc. it is used to determine whether analyte detection can be affected by the difference between the diluent used for preparation and the experimental sample matrix. to perform a spike - and - recovery test, a known amount of analyte ( i.e., target protein in our case ) is added to a matrix ( i.e., blood or urine in our case ). spike. the concentration of the added analyte in the matrix is determined from standard curves prepared. adiponectin is a protein hormone that modulates a number of metabolic processes, including glucose regulation and fatty acid oxidation. adiponectin is exclusively secreted from adipose tissue into the bloodstream and is very abundant in plasma relative to many hormones. however, the patterns of change in urinary adiponectin levels in various diseases remain unknown, because the urinary adiponectin levels are thought to be extremely low. spike - and - recovery tests using urine confirmed the reliability of our ultrasensitive elisa. the limit of detection for adiponectin was 2.3  10 moles / assay ( 0.069 pg / assay ) with a linear calibration curve of 4.2  10 moles / assay. the coefficient of variation was 4% for 1.7  10 moles / assay of adiponectin. the pilot study showed that the urinary adiponectin levels, which were corrected by the creatinine concentration, were higher in diabetes mellitus patients than in healthy subjects. further, these urinary adiponectin levels tended to increase with the progression of diabetes mellitus accompanied by nephropathy. glucose is transported from the intestines or liver to bodily cells via the bloodstream, and is made available for cell absorption via the hormone insulin, produced primarily in the pancreas. recently, the examination of single - cell metabolism has begun, particularly in the brain, and thus a highly sensitive measurement of sugars is also needed for this purpose. glucose oxidase ( god ) reduces oxygen o2 to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the presence of glucose. this reaction occurs in a glucose dose - dependent manner, and thus the concentration of h2o2 corresponds to that of glucose. thus, we focused on the development of a system to detect trace amounts of h2o2. if h2o2 is detected with high sensitivity, various substrates, such as cholesterol, choline, glutamate, lactate, nad(p)h, urate, and xanthine, can be also detected with high sensiti - vity with the help of their corresponding oxidases, because h2o2 is generated by these oxidase - catalyzed reactions. that is, the use of oxidase - catalyzed reactions offers us a chance to develop a versatile system. for this purpose, we selected a special method, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ), which, along with its derived methods, has been applied to characterize and determine fluorescent components in aqueous solution. fcs is a technique in which spontaneous fluorescence intensity fluctuations are measured in a microscopic detection volume of about 10 l ( fl ) defined by a tightly focused laser beam. analysis of fluorescence fluctuation offers the information on mobility and the concentrations of fluorescent components in sample solution. fluorescence intensity fluctuations measured by fcs represent changes in either the number or the fluorescence quantum yield of molecules resident in the detection volume. when a fluorescent probe of low molecular weight binds to a protein in a sample solution, the slow - diffusing component ( protein labeled with fluorescent probes ) increases with the decrease in the fast - diffusing component ( fluorescent probe ), which affects the fluorescence autocorrelation curve in fcs. the fluorescence autocorrelation curve is obtained after the fluctuations are recorded as a function of time and is statistically analyzed by autocorrelation analysis. the average residence time and the absolute numbers of slow- and fast - diffusing components in a small volume can be deduced by the fluorescence autocorrelation function calculated from the fluorescence autocorrelation curve. this situation is in marked contrast to conventional fluorescence photometry, which is carried out in sample volumes of around 0.1 - 1.0  ml ( about 10 times larger than fcs measurement volumes ) and provides only the macroscopic average of diffusion - dependent intensity fluctuations. in a typical fcs measurement, the fluorescence intensity is recorded for a small number of molecules in the detection volume ( e.g., a few molecules / fl, equivalent to an approximately nanomolar concentration ) over a time range from about 1  s to 1  s. that is, even though fcs does not require physical separation between free and bound fluorescent probes, it enables us to detect the molecules at a nanomolar level. then, to measure fcs, we considered a small volume of a fluorescent probe and a large volume of a protein that should be labeled with the fluorescent probe. we used tyramide labeled with tetramethyl rhodamine ( tyramide -

       "  'input': \"a friend aged in her early 40 's recently recounted her experience in hospital after having her first child . like most women , \\n she had gained weight during her pregnancy placing her pre - delivery weight at around 95 kg . \\n one of the nurses working on the maternity ward came into the room my friend shared with several other mothers and their newborns . \\n my friend explained that the nurse looked around the room and then came straight over to her bed and asked ,  are you the woman with gestational diabetes? she was not . \\n it was the younger ( mid 20s ) and physically much smaller woman in the bed across the room . \\n at a recent lunch time gathering , another friend , also in her 40s , revealed that she had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm )  something she was not expecting and was clearly surprised by . \\n i eat well and i exercise , i mean , i drink a bit , sure , hell , we all have our vices , but i 'm not fat , never have been . \\n so how is it that i have bloody diabetes? these incidents reveal a growing conflation between overweight , obesity , and diabetes in the public imagination  and it is this union and its appearance across a range of fields and discourses and media that is the focus of this paper . t2 \\n dm is a condition marked by high levels of glucose in the blood , caused by a reduced capacity or inability to produce insulin  a hormone generated in the pancreas that controls blood glucose levels ( who 1999 ) . \\n the disease often goes undetected for years and early symptoms include increased tiredness , thirst , urination , hunger , and weight gain . \\n it is the most common form of diabetes and occurs mostly in people aged 50 and over ( aihw 2012 , 298 ) . \\n it is strongly associated with ageing , genetics , a family history of the disease , previous gestational diabetes , ethnicity , nutrition , and poverty  the interplay of which is not well understood ( gard and wright 2005 ; ridderstrle and groop 2009 , 111 ; vassy and meigs 2012 , 191 ; wilson et al . 2007 ) . \\n having a parent with diabetes  increases one 's risk for the disease by 40% ( kbberling and tillil 1982 , 2003 ) . \\n 1992 ; meigs et al . 2000 ; poulsen et al . 1999 ; ridderstrle and groop 2009 , 111 ; vassy et al . \\n it is thought that t2 dm is both polygenetic and heterogeneous : that multiple genes are involved and that different combinations are at play in different groups or individuals ( poulsen et al . \\n 1999 ; doria , patti , and khan 2008 , 186 ; rich 1990 ; kahn , vicent , and doria 1996 ) . \\n ( 2011 , e77 ) suggest that while parental history ( which includes familial and ethnic clustering ) and specific gene variants play a significant role , there are likely to be  modest associations with the environment and unknown genetic factors . \\n evidence is also emerging that second - generation anti - psychotics  increasingly used to treat anxiety and depression  create metabolic changes that bring on diabetes and lead to significant weight gain to a even greater degree than first generation drugs ( allison et al . \\n obese ( bmi & ge ; 30 ) , people from a broad range of body weights and bmi 's ( including those considered \\n the largest national study into diabetes prevalence in australia estimated that 44% of participants with impaired glucose were obese  suggesting that 56% were not  and that 15.9% of those who were obese did not have impaired glucose ( dunstan et al . \\n the australian government 's bi - annual health reports are based on self - reported data , and they too have shown a rise in the incidence of t2 dm from 193,000 ( 1.3% ) in 19891990 to 818,000 ( 3.9% ) in 20072008 ( aihw 2012 , 299 , 2010 ) . however , while an increase in disease incidence has played a role here , it is widely acknowledged that a significant aging population , increased life expectancy , rising community awareness , improved detection , survival , and improved access to health care services are important contributors ( aihw 2010 , 154 , 2012 ; vassy and meigs 2012 , 191 ; wilson et al . \\n has evolved as a major health problem because of increasing life expectancies in many parts of the world , including australia , which has a large aging population . despite the complex causal pathways that lead to diabetes , the disease is increasingly represented in deceptively simple terms . since 2000 \\n researchers , commentators and policy - makers in australia have linked the rise in diabetes directly to increases in obesity in the same populations ( barr et al . \\n 2006 ; duke , colagiuri , and colagiuri 2009 ; dunstan et al . 2001 ; zimmet 2001 ) . over the last decade , \\n government health reports , strategies and plans focused on diabetes , consistently identify obesity / diabetes as a major and escalating health problem that is now commonly referred to as an  epidemic. as gard and wright ( 2005 , 101102 ) have pointed out ,  much of the rhetoric around the so - called \\n obesity epidemic is based on the spurious claim that obesity causes or is one of the important multiple causes of non - insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or \\n ischemic heart disease. and yet , the potency of overweight and obesity as a cultural signifier for diabetes in australia , and its iatrogenic consequences for those diagnosed with or deemed  at risk for the disease , are topics that have received little critical examination to date . \\n this paper sets out to map the perceived linkages between t2 dm and body weight in australia . \\n an extensive literature search was undertaken in september 2012 for sources published in , or about , australia since 1988 using the databases lexisnexus , proquest , and factiva . \\n searches for  diabesity ,  obesity risk diabetes ,  obesity causes diabetes and  weight or fat causes diabetes were used and a total of 81 items were located : 42 media stories , 22 peer - reviewed articles , and 17 government and non - government reports . \\n this includes national health reports and policy briefs from health agencies , diabetes research centers and associations ( ngo 's ) , journal articles , and media reports and commentaries . \\n this analysis is based on repeated critical readings of these texts to examine the ways in which the relationship between diabetes and overweight / obesity are discussed while tracking this chronologically , through time . \\n i am particularly interested in how  and when  discourses on overweight , obesity , and diabetes began to converge in australia . \\n of course , it is acknowledged that diabetes , weight , and diet have a long and complex history \\n however , this analysis suggests that certain convergences and framings that have become naturalized in recent years began to appear from at least the late 1990s . \\n the paper also highlights some of the potential implications of this convergence in light of recent research examining the relationship between weight stigma , discrimination , and diabetes management . \\n diabetes was not part of the australian national health agenda until 1998 , when it was named as the fifth nation health priority area ( nhpa ) , alongside cardiovascular health , cancer control , injury prevention and control , and mental health ( cdhc and aihw 1999 ) . over the last 15 years and despite the ongoing uncertainty about the etiology of diabetes , overweight and obesity are increasingly presented not only as risk factors , but also as a contributors to and generators of the disease , across a spectrum of publications and mediums . while weight and diabetes have had a long association , the conflations exposed here began to appear in australia in the late 1990s . in 1998 , \\n the national t2 dm strategy and implementation plan for australia was released by diabetes australia ( colagiuri , colagiuri , and ward 1998 ) . \\n the focus was on people , providers , policy , and programs and called for a national diabetes task force to oversee the execution of the plan ( colagiuri , colagiuri , and ward 1998 , xv ) . in this strategy , t2 dm \\n is clearly framed as  a major public health concern and as  reaching epidemic proportions ( colagiuri , colagiuri , and ward 1998 , x ) . \\n although there is a call for increasing biomedical research into the disease , and un - modifiable and modifiable risk factors are described ( including obesity and overweight ) , the greatest emphasis is on \\n lifestyle interventions ( colagiuri , colagiuri , and ward 1998 , 18 ) . indeed , the authors assert that  [ l]ifestyle factors such as overweight , inactivity and diet predispose to its [ diabetes ] development ( colagiuri , colagiuri , and ward 1998 ) . \\n the plan 's release followed that of the much publicized who report that announced the emergence of a global obesity epidemic ( who 1998 ) . \\n the national strategy was endorsed in 1999 with the federal health minister calling for the country to  defuse the diabetes time bomb! and stating that  australians are facing a diabetes epidemic within 10 years if immediate changes are not made to our lifestyle and diet ( australian government 1999 ) . in that same year , a new study was commissioned to determine diabetes and obesity prevalence in a randomly selected population that would provide baseline data for future interventions and the beginning of a longitudinal study . published in 2001 , the australia diabetes , obesity and lifestyle study 2000 ( ausdiab  2000 ) saw the emphases on weight given significantly more prominence ( dunstan et al . \\n the title of the study ,  diabesity and associated disorders in australia  2000 : the accelerating epidemic, evidences this shift in emphasis towards obesity / diabetes . \\n it is also earliest use of the  diabesity found in an australian government document . throughout the document , \\n epidemic of some  magnitude that is being driven by increasing rates of overweight and obesity ( dunstan et al . \\n 2001 , x ) . the who ( 1998 ) report proclaiming the existence of a \\n global obesity epidemic is given considerable prominence in the study and is the primary source of evidence for an obesity epidemic in australia . \\n following an introduction and background chapter detailing what diabetes mellitus is , the next and third chapter in the ausdiab study is called  overweight and obesity , suggesting to the reader the import of these  factors. it begins with the following opening statement :  since obesity is strongly linked to type 2 diabetes , the term  diabesity has been recently used to embrace the two conditions ( dunstan et al . \\n so connected are the two conditions in this framing that a new term is now to be used to encompass both : diabesity . \\n the authors then detail rates of overweight and obesity in australia and conclude that : the principal finding [ of the study ] was the high prevalence of being overweight , both in the pre - obese and obese ranges amongst the ausdiab participants . \\n the likelihood is that the increased levels of obesity have been a significant contributing factor in the escalating prevalence of diabetes . \\n the epidemic of obesity must be curtailed in order to reduce the impact on diabetes , as well as other obesity - related conditions . \\n ( dunstan et al . 2001 , 13 ) in this framing , overweight and obesity are not symptoms of diabetes but have become a  significant contributing factor ; diabetes has emerged as an  obesity - related condition of epidemic proportions and the two \\n , however , the ausdiab study ( 2001 ) also reported that only 44% of participants with impaired glucose were obese  suggesting that 56% were not ( dunstan et al . \\n furthermore , the later chapters of the report are entitled : dyslipidemia , hypertension , smoking , physical activity , risk factors for cardiovascular disease , and indicators of renal disease . \\n none are dedicated to non - modifiable  risk factors , or to the role of an aging population or improvements in diagnosis as factors contributing to diabetes prevalence in the population . \\n notably , while hypertension is reported as present in 63% of participants with glucose impairment , it is covered after the chapter on obesity and overweight . the ausdiab study  2000 exhibits a conflicted and at times contradictory position on the relationship between weight and diabetes , describing the disease as follows : type 2 diabetes is characterised by resistance to insulin 's action and impaired insulin production by the pancreas , either of which may predominate . \\n it is the most common form of diabetes accounting for more than 85% of persons with diabetes in australia . \\n it has a strong genetic ( familial ) propensity , which is unmasked by lifestyle factors such as obesity ( hence the term  diabesity  ) and lack of exercise . in most instances , the molecular or metabolic causation is not yet known . \\n 2001 , 2 ) this description exemplifies the kinds of slippage that occur in the framing of diabetes and its convergence with obesity and overweight . \\n while the authors highlight the significance of genetics , they also argue that  lifestyle or environmental factors can  unmask or activate diabetes . in doing so , \\n they make it clear that overweight or obesity alone would not cause diabetes , unless the person already has a genetic predisposition . \\n however , this also undermines the use of the term  diabesity and the direct connection it implies between diabetes and obesity . \\n the authors then go on to conclude that the actual causes of diabetes are  not yet known and , in doing so , effectively undermine everything they have said before . \\n the ausdiab study  2000 signaled the emergence of a rising  enemy in the fight against diabetes : overweight and obesity . \\n it gives considerable prominence to the view that overweight and obesity ( and the obesity \\n epidemic ) are behind increases in the incidence of diabetes , masking the complex etiology of the disease . and \\n the study received strong coverage at the time , alongside other reports about australia 's alleged obesity epidemic . \\n headlines included  weighty problems set to spark  diabesity epidemic ( o'dwyer 2001 ) . \\n interviews with the authors stated the ausdiab study  2000 had shown that a  diabesity epidemic would hit australia within 10 years ( o'dwyer 2001 ) . by early 2002 , some commentators were linking australia 's emerging \\n the influential and heavily cited ausdiab study  2000 also produced a five - year follow up study of the same cohort , called the australian diabetes , obesity and lifestyle study ( ausdiab 2005 ) : tracking the accelerating epidemic , its causes and outcomes ( barr et al . \\n , overweight and obesity are the focus of a dedicated chapter appearing immediately after the definition of diabetes . in this report \\n , the authors describe the disease as follows , with no explicit mention of non - modifiable factors : diabetes is a disease with mixed aetiology . \\n there are many risk factors for the development of the disease including obesity , hypertension , sedentary lifestyle , dyslipidaemia and the metabolic syndrome \\n 2006 , 6 ) the ausdiab study  2005 ( 2006 ) reports that in the five years since the first study the incidence of new diabetes in the cohort increased by a modest 0.8% . it also reported that those aged less than 65 years gained 1.8 kg , and those aged over 65 years lost 0.8 kg over the period  again a modest change ( barr et al . \\n nevertheless , the authors continue to use the language of  epidemic and to link not only diabetes , but now also pre - diabetes , to the  obesity epidemic in australia ( barr et al . \\n every two years , the australian government , via the australian institute of health and welfare ( aihw ) produces a report on the health of the nation , based on self - reported data . \\n a critical review of these reports from their inception in 1988 reveals an important shift . in the earlier reports  diet , relative weight and physical inactivity along with under nutrition \\n factors influencing risk for t2 dm ( aihw 1988 , 90 , 116119 , 1990 , 1992 ) . \\n however , from 2000 onwards , and following the who report ( 1998 ) , overweight and  in particular  obesity emerge as the most significant risk factors , with purported increases in diabetes rates increasingly linked to increases in the girth of the population . in the 19882006 reports , \\n however , from 2002 the ausdiab  2000 study is cited extensively , and it is here that obesity begins to emerge as an important driver of diabetes in australia . \\n for example , in the aiwa report of 2002 we find the following : dunstan et al . \\n ( 2001 ) suggest that the increased prevalence of obesity in australia has been a significant contributing factor in the increasing prevalence of diabetes , in particular type 2 diabetes ( p. 68 ) . \\n the ausdiab studies ( 2001 , 2005 ) have been cited extensively in all government health reports up to the present day . \\n although the term  diabesity was not generally used , these studies helped establish a position in which obesity is deemed to contribute to increasing rates of diabetes . in 2008 \\n , obesity was added to the list of australian nation health priority areas ( nhpa ) . in that same year , obesity was clearly identified as a central or primary cause of rises in the incidence of diabetes , in the aihw government health report , for example : there is likely to be strong growth in the level of diabetes over the next 20 years , mostly as a direct result of increasing levels of obesity . \\n ( aihw 2008 , 158 ) by 2010 , however , the aihw report explained the increase in diabetes as follows :  over the longer term and accounting for population changes , type 2 diabetes is projected to become the leading cause of disease burden by 2023 , partly attributable to the expanding problem of overweight and obesity ( aihw 2010 , 58 ) . by 2012 \\n , we find this :  the proportion of australian adults who do not already have type 2 diabetes but are overweight or obese is an indicator of australian adults who are at risk for type 2 diabetes ( aihw 2012 , 266 ) . \\n once again , the 56% of people who ( according to the 2001 ausdiab study  2000 ) are not obese but have diabetes are \\n it is also noteworthy that over time , when listing the risk factors for diabetes in government reports and websites ( as well as ngos like diabetes australia ) , obesity and/or overweight became increasingly prominent : listed first in most instances or second after aging . \\n for example , diabetes and its risk factors are discussed at several points throughout the 2010 aihw report , but only once are genetics , age , family history , and ethnic background mentioned in association with diabetes ( 152 ) . \\n the authors then immediately conclude : [ w]hile these risk factors can not be changed , there are also a number of modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes \\n notably obesity , physical inactivity and an unhealthy diet ( shaw and chisholm 2003 ) . \\n ( aihw 2010 , 152 ) for those with a family history of the disease or genetic susceptibility to it , asserting that diabetes is preventable for those willing to modify their lifestyle overstates the situation and the challenges faced in  managing the disease , while overlooking factors beyond individual control . repositioning overweight and obesity as the generator of diabetes and diabesity has also been replicated in the media . \\n diabesity on rise , experts say is the headline from an interview with paul zimmet , one of the authors of the ausdiab studies . in the interview , zimmet stated ,  junk food and soft drinks should be banned from hospitals , schools and other public institutions to help stem growing \\n diabesity ( sydney morning herald 2006 ) . later in the story and directly below zimmet 's credentials as the director of the international diabetes institute , we find this statement , \\n obesity is strongly linked with type-2 diabetes ; no other factors are listed ( sydney morning herald 2006 ) . \\n today , this re - positioning and re - signification is ubiquitous on commercial medical websites and those of national sports celebrities where health is the central theme . \\n this , for example , is from well - known health and fitness celebrity guy leech 's web site : type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes . \\n it was once called ,  mature onset diabetes  but inline with increasing obesity trends and the lowering of the age when sufferers become afflicted with this illness this name has been dropped . \\n in fact , so close is the relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes that the term  diabesity  has been coined ( www.guyleechfitness.com ) . alongside the framing of weight as a , or the central \\n risk factor for diabetes , there are also examples of obesity being named as a cause or the cause of diabetes . for example , cornes et al . \\n ( 2009:75 ) introduce their article on genetic variants in diabetes and bmi by stating that : \\n obesity causes or exacerbates many health problems including type 2 diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular disease , certain forms of cancer , respiratory complications and osteoarthritis. again , this is also evident in media coverage on the disease . for example , associate professor maarten kamp , a diabetes expert from the state of queensland , has commented that \\n obesity is a very important factor in contributing to diabetes , it 's certainly the main factor that 's contributing to the epidemic of diabetes that we have ( ninemsn 2006 ) . \\n reference to the emergence of a  twin or  diabetes epidemic fuelled by obesity has become commonplace in australia , driven in no small part by the ausdiab studies ( 2001 , 2005 ) , media commentary by its authors and government health priorities , reports , and education campaigns . \\n for example , since the late 1990s , australian federal health ministers have asserted that \\n australians are facing a diabetes epidemic within 10 years if immediate changes are not made to our lifestyle and diet or that  australia 's ageing , increasingly overweight and inactive population means the nation is well on the way to a diabetes epidemic ( australian government 1999 ) . \\n more recently , headlines stating ,  the federal government has reaffirmed its commitment to tackling the diabetes epidemic ( brimbank weekly 2010 ) and reports of new \\n frontiers under threat ,  diabetes epidemic looms in regional queensland frequently appear ( abc 2011a ) the idea that a diabetes epidemic is being driven by the earlier and ongoing \\n obesity epidemic has gained considerable ground in the media and in public health . by 2011 , \\n a senior commentator for the dietitians association of australia speaking at their national conference expressed her concern about the \\n twin epidemics of obesity and diabetes as follows : we are looking at an avalanche really , of people who are , who have become obese and are going to develop diabetes . \\n it has very serious consequences for our health budget and for our community and for those individuals . \\n diabesity epidemic , i.e the  obesity - leads - to - diabetes frame , is again highly visible , as the quote suggests . in the ways \\n the term diabesity is used in australia , the independent identities of obesity and diabetes are merged even further and become the looming and threatening \\n rob moodie , head of australia 's national preventative health taskforce , which is assigned with  turning around the obesity epidemic in australia , \\n described the situation as follows : its going to require a massive effort to stop the increases in overweight and obesity  also that obviously has a major impact on levels of diabetes so there is a notion of a sort of  diabesity epidemic  the double epidemic of obesity and diabetes  [ as ] something that we have to take very seriously . \\n ( abc 2008 ) paul zimmet has suggested that the un declare diabesity  an international health disaster ( the australian 2006 ) and that rising international rates \\n threaten to consume world economies and bankrupt health systems including australia 's ( zimmet 2000 ; 2001 ) . in an editorial in the medical journal of australia , \\n zimmett and james ( 2006 , 18788 ) argue that our consumption of unhealthy foods and  ever more sedentary leisure sees australia  facing a seemingly unstoppable juggernaut of obesity and diabetes. zimmet has also stated that indigenous australians and other aboriginal metis , or first nation peoples are at great risk of partial  if not total extinction within this century from diabesity ( the australian 2006 ; zimmet 2001 ) . as fee ( 2006 ) \\n has demonstrated , heavily racialized statements like these , with their imagery of death and extinction , are part of larger , post - colonial interpretations of obesity and diabetes in which notions of \\n race are used uncritically , as a proxy for presumed genetic differences . at another level , \\n linking diabetes and overweight / obesity together in such politically charged ways , serves to elevate the role of overweight and obesity as risk factors or , more disturbingly , as causes of diabetes . \\n diabesity epidemic implies a single , all pervasive cause for diabetes nationally and globally , namely obesity ( overweight / obesity ) . according to haslam ( 2012 ) \\n , this usage masks the fact that : obese individuals have a host of other comorbidities to contend with in addition to type 2 diabetes , [ that ] not everyone who is obese will develop type 2 diabetes , [ and ] not everyone with a high risk of type 2 diabetes is necessarily obese . \\n ( 334 ) yet , despite the problems with this conflation , it has become thoroughly naturalized amongst australian researchers , policy - makers , media , and the public . \\n today , there is an annual  diabetes and diabesity day in australia  an education event where allied health professionals provide information to the public  and leading australian academics in the field of diabetes are on the editorial board of a new academic journal called diabesity in practice ( http://www.diabesityinpractice.co.uk/ ) . \\n the growing emphasis on diabesity and/or the obesity / diabetes epidemic must be located within a broader cultural context in which overweight and obesity have come to act as powerful cultural signifiers for poor health and a range of diseases . \\n increasingly the larger - than - average body has come to signify a person who , by virtue of their girth , engages in risky behavior and an unhealthy irresponsible lifestyle that places them at risk for a range of health issues and diseases ( austin 1999 ; bell and mcnaughton 2007 ; bell , mcnaughton , and salmon 2009 , 2011 ; campos 2004 ; campos et al . \\n 2006 ; gard and wright 2005 ; jutel 2001 , 2008 ; le besco 2011 ; mcnaughton 2011 ; monaghan 2008 ; murray 2008 ; petersen and lupton 1997 ) . \\n for example , in the 1980s and 1990s , watson ( 1993 , 248 ) and crawford 's ( 1984 , 7071 ) us - based studies , found that those whose body weights were in the highest ranges were consistently assumed to be the persons most likely to be \\n unhealthy. in an australian study on cholesterol , participants commonly assumed a direct link between body shape and cholesterol : fatness , inactivity , and over - nutrition equaled high cholesterol for many ( lupton and chapman 1995 , 488 ) . \\n davison , smith , and frankel 's ( 1991 ) research into heart disease demonstrated that \\n contenders for heart disease ( see also backett , davison , and mullen 1994 , davison , frankel , and smith 1992 ) . such prejudices are not limited to the lay public , as there is considerable evidence to suggest that health care providers hold negative and prejudicial attitudes towards overweight patients , assuming that weight is the source of their ills ( anderson and wadden 2004 ; ferraro and holland 2002 ; oberrieder et al . \\n the idea of an obesity / diabetes epidemic therefore crystallizes broader assumptions about the dangerousness of fat and the idea that poor health is simply the result of changeable , risky behaviors which in turn , have created another potentially more deadly scourge in the form of a  diabesity epidemic . \\n overweight and obese people are imagined either as diabetic or as inevitably becoming diabetic . in this \\n framing , the overweight or obese body / person signifies a diseased body / person , or a body / person with high disease potential  diseases that are self - inflicted through risky behavior . \\n there is little room here for the idea of weight as a symptom of diabetes , for the notion that some overweight or obese people never develop the disease , or that some people whose body weight is considered \\n this convergence of weight with diabetes opens the way for what finerman and bennett ( 1995 ) called  a blame - oriented model , wherein responsibility and blame for  disease , its onset and outcomes are  ascribed to the afflicted. diagnostically , the response to the onset of td2 m or indications that it may be developing is glycemic control , via diet , weight loss , exercise , medications or insulin , often in combination . \\n however , as the authors of aihw report ( 2010 ) note ,  type 2 diabetes may be managed with changes to diet and exercise , oral glucose lowering drugs , insulin injections or a combination of these ( aihw 2008 , 3 , my emphasis ) . as this statement suggests , for some , \\n diabetes is not easily managed by diet , exercise and/or medications , although this is rarely stated explicitly in the literature examined here . \\n furthermore , disease progression can occur even with optimal management . as van der does ( 1997 , \\n 34 ) notes ,  in type 2 diabetes , definite conclusions about the role of long - term glycemic control in preventing complications can not be drawn yet. nevertheless , weight reduction or management is often a central aim of glucose control . however , \\n if patients are not losing weight or struggling to do so , health staff may lose patience or express a lack of empathy , shaming or further stigmatizing them ( cossrow , jeffery , and mc quire 2001 ; teixeira and budd 2010 ) . \\n failure or be made to feel responsible for their diabetes in a way that is shaming or stigmatizing . \\n conversely , a lack of emphasis on the limitations of current management strategies leads some patients to develop unrealistic expectations that can not be met or to believe they have been cured as parry et al . \\n conversations about weight , weight loss , diet , and exercise are commonplace in health care encounters around t2 dm and several studies suggest that experiencing or expecting weight discrimination may be causing people to evade or delay health care or treatment . \\n for example , teixeira and budd ( 2010 ) suggest that the shame of not having lost weight and the fear of being reprimanded are a key factor in t2 dm patients postponing or avoiding follow - up visits . \\n peyrot , mcmurry , and kruger ( 1999 ) study into possible psychological barriers to diabetes care , also found that many participants with t2 dm felt very anxious and ashamed about their weight . in a similar vein , a survey undertaken in aotearoa \\n ( 2007 ) indicated that obesity was an obstacle to patients seeking diabetes support , along with other health conditions and economic barriers . \\n another study by drury and louis ( 2002 ) indicates a direct correlation between avoidance or delay of health care with women 's perceptions of weight and stigma . although this study did not consider men 's experiences , broader arguments about men , service use , and weight stigma would suggest that they too , may be avoiding health care ( bell and mcnaughton 2007 , monaghan 2008 ) . \\n teixeira and budd ( 2010 ) argue that obesity stigma is a likely barrier to ongoing diabetes management and that health providers need to improve their sensitivity , devote more time to interactions with overweight patients , and reflect more self critically on their own assumptions about weight and how these are being communicated to clients . \\n they also call for health staff to employ particular counseling strategies with their  obese t2 dm patients that will improve disease management and reduce patients experience of weight stigma . \\n although teixeira and budd ( 2010 ) assume that most diabetics are overweight , overlooking those who may not be overweight but are still at risk for the disease , their points regarding the potentially negative impacts of weight stigma on t2 dm patients echo a larger body of literature suggesting that the stigma associated with particular conditions and practices ( e.g. hiv / aids , illicit drug use , tobacco use , etc . ) often creates substantial barriers to health care . \\n studies into the stigmatizing of drug users , smokers , consumers of alcohol , and those with hiv  aids strongly indicates that stigmatizing and marginalizing people in these ways is likely to leave them alienated , anxious , and removed from the kinds of services that they might need and potentially with poor mental and physical health as a result ( krieger 2000 ; kvernmo and heyerdahl 2003 ; link and phelan 2001 ; mason 2001 ; puhl and heuer 2009 , 2010 ; todd and fisher 1993 ) . \\n there are a number of studies indicating that the more insidious , subtle daily expressions of discrimination provide a powerful baseline from which patients evaluate their health care experiences ( browne 2003 ; johnson et al . \\n 2004 ) and that this may discourage people from seeking support or attending follow - up visits . while there have been calls internationally and in australia to de - normalize fatness through the use of shaming and stigma , the taxing of \\n junk food , removal of overweight and/or diabetic children from their parents and so on , the ethical and iatrogenic consequences of this are likely to be considerable as i and others have shown ( bell , mcnaughton , and salmon 2009 , 2011 ; mcnaughton 2011 ) . like burris ( 2008 , 475 ) \\n , i would argue that stigma can not be used in an ethical way , because it is , by definition , an \\n following burris ( 2008 , 475 ) i would also ask :  where is there good evidence that inculcating a sense of a spoiled identity is a good way to get people to adopt healthier behaviours? \\n clearly , the idea that fatness is the most significant  risk factor or central cause of type 2 diabetes mellitus has become pervasive and thoroughly naturalized in australian media representations , public health campaigns , popular discourse , and scholarly research . in this \\n framing , the gaps in current knowledge around the causes of diabetes or the role of weight in insulin resistance , or as a symptom of t2 dm are elided . \\n lifestyle are less open to change ( and intervention ) , or beyond individual control  such as genetics , poverty , family history etc . \\n in the weight - causes - diabetes framing and in the creation of a new condition \\n diabesity in which the two fully merge , the complexity and multiplicity of causes associated with the disease are lost or rendered invisible . \\n all that can be seen are obesity , diabetes , and the unhealthy lifestyle that allegedly created them . here , \\n weight , and to a lesser degree diabetes , are framed as primarily self - inflicted : the result of wholly changeable and highly risky lifestyle factors  notably over - nutrition and physical inactivity . \\n fatness causes diabetes linkage overstates the evidence , turns symptoms into causes , and understates the complexity of the issue ( also see burris 2008 ) . \\n given that t2 dm can emerge in people from a range of weight ranges  including those considered \\n such a correlation may have ethical implications for their experience and interpretation of the symptoms of the disease , its prevention , and diagnosis .\",\n",
       "  'output': 'although overweight and obesity are increasingly seen as the key  risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) , the relationship between them is complex and not well understood . \\n there are many \\n risk factors for t2 dm , including ageing , genetics , previous gestational diabetes , a family history of the disease , etc . \\n the interplay of which is not entirely clear . \\n while weight gain is a common symptom of t2 dm and the disease appears to be more prevalent among  obese people , individuals from a broad range of weights ( including those considered \\n healthy ) can develop the disease . \\n however , in recent years , the idea that fatness is the risk factor and/or central cause of t2 dm has become increasingly prevalent and naturalized in popular , academic , and public health discourses in australia . in these convergences , \\n the complex etiology of the disease and limitations in current knowledge are blurred or reconstituted . \\n to date , the potency of overweight and obesity as cultural signifiers for t2 dm and its consequences has received little attention . \\n drawing on an analysis of government reports , journal articles , and media coverage published since 1998 , this article sets out to trace and unpack some of the contours of these convergences , while recognizing their entanglement in earlier moralizing discourses , which continue to have considerable salience .',\n",

       "  'model_output': 'the increasing in expectation of life is associated with a higher prevalence of chronic disease, which may lead to physical limitations and reduce quality of life. cardiovascular diseases ( cvd ) are a principal cause of deaths in brazil.1 furthermore, they represent the greatest expenditure in medical assistance by the central governmental health provider, sistema nico de sade ( sus).2 increasing prevalence of cvd is seen not only in brazil, but also other countries, regardless of their level of socioeconomic development.3,4 in the majority of cases, cvd have well known etiologies and risk factors.5 the world health organization ( who ) classifies the risk factors into two groups, those related to the individual and those related to the environment. the individual risk factors are : general ( age, sex, formal education level, heredity ), associated with lifestyle ( tobacco use, diet, sedentary lifestyle ), and intermediate or biological [ systemic arterial hypertension ( ah ), obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus ( dm ) ]. environmental risk factors consist of urbanization and socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental conditions.68 nationwide studies have shown that these factors may contribute to the risk of acute myocardial infarction.9,10 beginning in the 1990s, general cardiovascular risk was assessed in the individuals and populations, driving preventive measures and approaches to treat and control cardiovascular diseases. the general cardiovascular risk assesses to what extent a specific combination of cardiovascular risk factors are present simultaneously in the same person.11 this approach has led quality of life to be included as a relevant aspect in the evaluation of individuals health. the identification of clinical variables that reduce quality of life should help to ensure the adoption of health measures with the greatest possible impact on their target populations.12 there are two main conceptualizations of quality of life, one that is more generic and another that relates specifically to health.1315 despite the relevance this issue, little is known about quality of life in the population. in addition, no studies have investigated the possibility that the presence of individual risk factors for cvd is associated with decreased quality of life. therefore the present study aimed to evaluate quality of life in a population that voluntarily visited a specific community health education event, and to analyze whether their quality of life was associated with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. the study retrospectively evaluated 332 completed whoqol questionnaires ( brief version),16 as well as demographic and physical data of volunteers participating in a community event on health education held in may of 2006 in botucatu, localized in the central region of the state of sao paulo. this event was an annual event promoted by a student association of the school of medicine, student groups participated and professors acted as advisors. this event occurred in a public park on a weekend following extensive publicity in the local media. all of the volunteers signed consent forms, thereby agreeing to participate in the research. the project was submitted to and approved by the research ethics committee of the botucatu medical school - unesp ( of.053/08-cep ). the individuals were interviewed by trained medical students to obtain information on personal and familial antecedents, life conditions, and habits. after the interview, each subject s weight and height were measured using a conventional electronic balance. arterial pressure was taken with an aneroid sphygmomanometer after the individual had rested for five minutes in a seated position. glycemia was measured using roche portable glycemia monitors ( accu - chek active model ) and roche accu - chek reagent strips. for this test, the following values were considered normal : systolic arterial pressure 140 mmhg ; diastolic arterial pressure 90 mmhg ; casual glycemia 200 mg / dl. individuals were considered hypertensive or diabetic if they self - reported the disease or if they were under specific treatment. the body mass index ( bmi, kg / m ) was calculated from values of weight ( p, kg ) and height ( a, m ) as follows : bmi = p / a2. values greater than or equal to 25 kg / m were considered indicative of being overweight or obese. quality of life scores were calculated from the responses to the whoqol questionnaire ( brief version ), which includes 26 questions that evaluate the following domains and the facets within these domains17 : physical : pain and discomfort, energy and fatigue, sleep and rest, mobility, daily life activities, undergoing medication or other treatment, work capacity. psychological : positive sentiments ; thinking, learning, memory and concentration ; self - esteem ; body image and appearance ; negative sentiments ; spirituality / religion / personal beliefs. social relations : personal relations, social support, sexual activity. environment : physical safety and protection, environment in the home, financial resources, availability and quality of social and health care, opportunities for acquiring new information and abilities, participation in recreation / leisure opportunities, physical environment, such as level of pollution, noise, traphic, climate and transport. guidelines in the literature were followed for calculating the scores18 using the statistical package sigmastat for windows ( version 2.03, spss, inc. ). the median values of scores in the whoqol four domains were taken as the threshold for defining higher and lower scores. single - variable comparisons were performed using student s t - test or the mann - whitney or chi - square test. a multinomial logistic regression model was used to identify variables associated with a lower score for quality of life. variables introduced in the model were gender, age, dm, ah, self reported dyslipidemia, regular practice of physical exercises ( at least three times a week ), tobacco use, and access to information on cardiovascular risk. in all analyses, the level of significance was defined at p < 0.05. means and standard deviations of the clinical variables measured in the study population ( 146 men and 186 women ) are shown in table 1. there were no differences between men and women, except for higher diastolic arterial pressure observed among the men ( 84  12 mmhg vs. 81  12 mmhg ; p = 0.037 ). in the study population, 155 individuals were aged 60 years ( 46% ) ; of these, 87 ( 56% ) were women. considering the entire study population, 219 ( 66% ) had a bmi 25 kg / m, 162 ( 48.8% ) were classified as hypertensive, and 67 ( 20.2% ) had dm. nearly one - third ( 26.8% ) reported being dyslipidemic and 10.5% reported that they were using tobacco at the time of the study, while 31% reported prior but not present tobacco use. among all of the study participants, 47.6% denied regular practice of physical exercises, and 107 ( 32% ) reported having access to information on cardiovascular risk factors. the distribution of quality of life scores in the study population is shown in figure 1. the medians and their respective interquartile ranges were : 71.4 ( 60.782.1 ) in the physical domain, 70.8 ( 62.579.2 ) in the psychic domain, 75.0 ( 58.383.3 ) in the social domain, and 62.5 ( 56.375.0 ) in the environmental domain. the comparison between men and women revealed significant differences in the social domain ( p = 0.03 ) and the psychological domain(p < 0.001 ), with lower scores observed for the female gender. tables 24 show statistically significant results obtained with the multinomial logistic regression model. in the physical domain, lower scores for quality of life were associated with dm, dyslipidemia, and bmi  25 kg / m. the male gender showed a protective effect ; that is, being a man reduced the chance of a lower score in the physical domain by 45%. in the case of the environmental domain, being at least 60 years old and regularly practicing physical exercise were inversely associated with lower scores ( table 4 ). no variables were found to be independently associated with quality of life scores in the social domain. unadjusted analyses show that lack of access to information about cardiovascular risk factors prevented a higher score in the environmental domain ( or : 0.57 ; ic95%, 0.360.91 ; p = 0.018 ), although this association was not significant based on the multinomial logistic regression model. the present study aimed to evaluate quality of life in a specific population, which was composed mainly of individuals aged more than 50 years who showed a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. in addition, the study sought to examine whether the presence of these risk factors reduced their quality of life. the high frequencies of ah, hypercholesterolemia, tobacco use, dm, sedentary lifestyle, and elevated bmi in the study sample reflects the fact that participants were recruited from among individuals who voluntarily sought free health - related education and monitoring for cvd. for instance, although the mean arterial pressure values for the participant sample were within normal limits, nearly half of the participants qualified as being hypertensive. this frequency is higher than that described in previous population studies1921. nunes filho et al22 found the following risk factor frequencies in their study : ah, 14.7% ; dm, 2.3% ; tobacco use, 15.6% ; dyslipidemia, 18.75% ; and obesity, 15.6%. in a recent study, rozanski et al.24 divided the psychological and social alterations into two general categories in the context of quality of life : ( 1 ) emotional factors, which include affective disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety disorders, as well as hostile behavior and rage ; ( 2 ) chronic stressors, which include factors such as low social support and socioeconomic level, workplace stress, stress in marriage, and the stress of providing assistance to sick family members. the authors showed that patients with myocardial infarction and depressive symptoms presented significantly higher mortality within five years than patients without symptoms of depression. in the same study, depressive mood was associated with a 49% increase in the risk of coronary atherosclerotic disease. few studies in brazil have attempted to evaluate the association between cardiovascular risk factors and quality of life. a recent study by cavalcante et al.23, which included hypertensive patients, reported average scores between 60 and 70 ( on a scale of 0100 ) in different domains, as evaluated by another quality of life questionnaire. these values are very close to those found in our study, even though those authors used a different instrument to evaluate quality of life. the present study found that the presence of chronic diseases that confer a higher risk of cvd was inversely associated with quality of life scores. these results are in agreement with others who evaluated the impact of chronic diseases and higher cardiovascular risk on quality of life.12,20,2326 it is interesting to note that the present study found women to score lower on quality of life domains, consistent with the findings of other studies. previous studies have reported lower scores for quality of life for females due to deteriorating mental health.25 in their analysis of quality of life scores in a population aged 60 years or older, in a city in the central region of the state of minas gerais, pereira et al.26 observed that men showed higher scores than women in the physical, psychological, and environmental domains. our present study shows similar results, indicating that maleness reduces the chances of scoring lower in the physical and psychological domains by 45% and 60%, respectively. they have been attributed to factors that contribute to low self -

       "  'input': 'cardiac fibrosis is a common histopathological occurrence with many types of heart diseases , including ischemic heart disease , inherited cardiomyopathy mutations , diabetes , and ageing and is associated with morbidity and mortality . while there are several mechanisms of myocardial fibrosis with acute and chronic etiologies , increased accumulation of extracellular matrix ( ecm ) that impacts cardiac function , is the underlying cause of fibrotic heart disease . besides the disturbances in the mechanical functions of heart , fibrosis mediated scarring and electrical dysfunction often initiates ventricular arrhythmias , which in turn accelerates events towards heart failure and then sudden cardiac death ( 13 ) . \\n myocardial fibrosis presents one of the major challenges clinically not just to improve the survival rate and also the quality of life . cardiac magnetic resonance ( cmr ) \\n has been useful in measuring the extent of diffuse myocardial fibrosis , which is considered as a common pathological pathway that leads to the loss of myocardial function ( 4,5 ) . inasmuch as fibrosis can be reversible ( 6 ) , its quantification using cmr can be useful in changing the way the cardiac fibrosis patients are monitored and treated ( 7 ) . \\n myocardial fibrosis has been demonstrated in the pressure - loaded left ventricle of infants and children with aortic stenosis and coarctation ( 8) . \\n histological studies revealed right ventricular myofiber disorganization and interstitial fibrosis in patients with tetralogy of fallot ( 9 ) . \\n right ventricular fibrosis is not just found in late adult survivors , but actually is already present in infants suffering with this condition ( 10 ) . \\n alterations in myocardial architecture associated with fibrotic remodeling lead to deranged heart function in different ways . \\n thus , in patients after tetralogy of fallot repair , fibrous endocardial thickening of the right ventricular infundibulum is a predictor of poor right ventricular function ( 5 ) . on the other hand , \\n myocardial fibrosis is associated with systolic ventricular dysfunction early in life in patients with tricuspid atresia ( 11 ) . \\n healthy myocardium consists of mostly cardiomyocytes ( ~75% ) , with the remaining partition , the interstitium regions comprising of fibroblasts , endothelial cells , and coronary arteries ( 12 ) . \\n the fibroblasts participate in the continuous formation and degradation of ecm , which is composed of types i and iii collagen fibers , that act as the scaffold for the myocardium . \\n disturbances in the balance between collagen production and degradation in the ecm , that led to expansion of collagens , cause myocardial fibrosis . \\n such derangement occurs either due to the death of cardiomyocytes , or because of stimuli that trigger elevated collagen synthesis ( 13 ) . \\n i ) reactive interstitial fibrosis ( rif ) : this is characterized by an increase in collagen synthesis without much effect on the viability of myocardium ( 14 ) . \\n rif is considered as a type of myocardial remodeling and leads to an increased interstitial compartment volume without any associated changes in myocyte volume . \\n this type of fibrosis is associated with diffused deposition of collagen and occurs in response to increased pressure and/or volume loads as in the cases of hypertension , aortic stenosis , chronic regurgitation , and shunt , ischemia , hyperglycemia , or ageing . \\n rif , which generally presents with a progressive chronic course , is possibly reversible by curtailing the damage causing stimuli or even by targeted therapy . \\n ii ) replacement fibrosis : an increased type i collagen deposition and expansion of ecm , following cardiomyocyte death contributes to this type of fibrosis ( 14 ) . \\n the elevated levels of collagen fibers replace the dead cardiomyocytes , but lack the contractile and electric functionality . acute or chronic conditions that trigger cardiomyocyte death such as myocardial ischemia and events that damage the cardiomyocyte membrane integrity causing cell death , lead to diffused or focal replacement fibrosis . \\n unlike the rif , in replacement fibrosis , the affected myocardium is not viable and thus is unable to recover contractile properties following revascularization or by blocking the damaging process . \\n iii ) infiltrative interstitial fibrosis : this fibrosis is seen in conditions such as amyloidosis or anderson - fabry disease ( 14 ) . \\n inflammatory cell infiltration was proposed to be an important factor underlying the interstitial fibrosis seen in right ventricles of systemic sclerosis - associated pulmonary arterial hypertension ( 15 ) . \\n iv ) endomyocardial fibrosis ( emf ) : emf affects children under age of 2 years in tropical and subtropical regions , and involves the apical endocardium of either or both right and left ventricles . it has been suggested that emf as one of the primary causes of pediatric congestive heart failure , which is often overlooked clinically ( 16 ) . \\n there is no clear etiology for emf , but hypereosinophilia , infections , autoimmunity , genetic factors and nutritional deficiencies may play a role . \\n emf has been described to present in three phases : initial phase of acute carditis with febrile illness and with heart failure in severe cases ; an intermediary subacute phase followed by a chronic burnt - out phase ( 17 ) . \\n notably , emf is identified mostly at late stages of the disease and is not observed in the early phase of the disease . \\n however , following diagnosis , there is rapid onset of associated complications such as atrial fibrillation , thromboembolism and progressive atrioventricular valve regurgitation . \\n emf patients display clinical features of heart failure , with enlargement of both atria with normally functioning ventricles during echocardiography ( 18 ) . \\n currently , the approach to treat emf patients is by surgery , involving targeted endocardial resection combined with valve repair or replacement , as there is no specific medical treatment ( 16 ) . \\n although the biology of cardiomyocyte and its apoptotic or necrotic death have been the focus of several investigations addressing cardiac diseases , increasing evidence suggests cardiac fibroblasts in the pathogenic mechanisms ( 19,20 ) . \\n fibroblasts , which are abundant in the normal myocardium , have a structural function by providing support ( 21 ) . however , when these normally quiescent fibroblasts are activated , they transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts , which appear similar to a hybrid of fibroblast and smooth muscle cells . myofibroblasts are able to effectively secrete and myofibroblasts are absent in healthy heart , they appear within days following a cardiac injury ( 22 ) . \\n myofibroblasts appear as spindle - shaped and possess dendritic - like processes ( 23 ) that protrude from the cell body . \\n characteristic elongated and serrated nuclei , extensive areas of rough endoplasmic reticulum and irregular non - sarcomeric myofibrillar structures are morphological features of myofibroblasts as observed in electron micrographs of pressure - overloaded rat heart cross sections ( 24 ) . \\n specific protein markers of myofibroblasts are mainly the ecm proteins , such as periostin , collagens i and iii and fibronectin ( 25 ) . besides these ecm proteins , myofibroblasts also express smooth muscle -actin , sm22 and caldesmon ( 26,27 ) . of note , \\n most of the myofibroblasts present in the border zone and approximately half of those in the fibrotic lesions of damaged myocardium , express embryonic smooth muscle myosin and -sma but not other smooth muscle markers , which is a major difference from smooth muscle cells ( 28 ) . \\n it has been suggested that there are two stages in the transformation of myofibroblast : in the first stage , there is development of  proto - myofibroblasts from fibroblasts , with the characteristic formation of cytoplasmic actin stress fibers and small adhesion complexes , which facilitate the migration of these cells to the injured myocardium , where these cells secrete collagens and fibronectin and assume physical orientation in order to align themselves with the primary stress axes of the injured tissue ( 25 ) . in the second stage , which starts approximately 2030 h following cardiac injury , the cytokines and mechanical stress convert these proto - myofibroblasts to mature myofibroblasts , which express -sma , which forms the stress fiber network ( 25 ) . with further maturation of the myofibroblast , besides the -sma , cadherin-11 is also secreted and adds to the strength of the stress fiber network ( 29 ) ( fig . \\n 1 ) . normally myofibroblasts have a protective function in the heart by participating acutely in injury repair response . \\n although uninterrupted fibrosis can be dangerous to heart , the function of myofibroblasts is important to maintain functional myocardium following any stress insult . \\n thus , following myocardial infarction , when cardiomyocytes die over several days due to ischemia , myofibroblasts play a major role in the remodeling of a fibrotic scar in the affected myocardium , in order to prevent wall rupture ( 30,31 ) . \\n myofibroblasts eventually disappear , through less understood mechanisms , in many situations of wound healing . \\n one possible mechanism is that following the formation of permanent scar and stabilization of cardiac injury , which may take up to 2 weeks , a significant proportion of the myofibroblasts undergo senescence ( 32 ) and/or apoptosis ( 33 ) . \\n it has also been proposed that some of the myofibroblasts may dedifferentiate back to fibroblast phenotype , even though strong evidence for this is lacking in myocardium . \\n critical for the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis is the persistent presence of myofibroblasts in the myocardium , long after the resolution of stress insult ( fig . \\n this is generally either due to concurrent dysregulation of neuroendocrine factors or even mechanical stress , both of which lead to and aggravate chronic cardiac fibrosis and/or hypertrophic scarring ( 34,35 ) . a common example for this is the intermittent ischemia , chronically affecting the heart , creating constant wound healing milieu , which leads to persistent activation and formation of the myofibroblasts and the eventual fibrosis ( 30 ) . \\n it has been proposed that the function of resident fibroblasts is to maintain normal tissue integrity and structure , whereas , acute injury or altered neuroendocrine signaling stimulates fibroblasts from other sources , which ultimately contribute to pathophysiologic fibrosis ( 36,37 ) \\n . a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in cardiac fibrosis and the regulation of the players involved such as myofibroblast formation and activation , is essential for developing effective therapeutics . \\n the most commonly employed techniques in patients with congenital heart disease to assess the fibrotic features of myocardium include stress echocardiography and cmr and also positron emission tomography ( pet ) , which is the reference standard for monitoring myocardial viability . \\n stress echocardiography allows for the assessment of myocardial contractile reserve in patients with adequate acoustic windows . \\n because of this , the main limitation of stress echocardiography is decreased diagnostic accuracy in patients with poor acoustic windows ( 38 ) . \\n pet scan is a nuclear scintigraphy and employs n -

angiotensin - aldosterone system ( raas ) , regulate the dynamic collagen turnover , and disturbances in these systems lead to an imbalance between collagen synthesis and degradation with the resultant accumulation of collagen , the underlying factor of cardiac fibrosis , followed by deranged myocardial architecture ( 41 ) . \\n thus it has been shown that pharmacological intervention of raas could prevent this process of fibrosis and at times even reverse the damage caused ( 42 ) . \\n thus , aldosterone antagonism with spironolactone has been found to lower collagen levels in hearts , ex vivo ( 43 ) , improve diastolic function ( 44 ) , decrease left ventricular size and ejection fraction ( 45 ) , and also mortality ( fig . \\n 2 ) ( 46 ) . there is ample evidence indicating increased expression of transforming growth factor- ( tgf- ) in response to injury and tgf- is known to play an important role during fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation , and also fibrosis ( fig . \\n 2 ) ( 47,48 ) . tgf- acts via binding to its cell surface receptor , activin linked kinase 5 ( alk5 ) , which phosphorylates smad2 and 3 . \\n phospho -

       "  'model_output': 'cardiac fibrosis is a common histopathological occurrence with many types of heart diseases, including ischemic heart disease, inherited cardiomyopathy mutations, diabetes, and ageing and is associated with morbidity and mortality. while there are several mechanisms of myocardial fibrosis with acute and chronic etiologies, increased accumulation of extracellular matrix ( ecm ) that impacts cardiac function, is the underlying cause of fibrotic heart disease. besides the disturbances in the mechanical functions of heart, fibrosis mediated scarring and electrical dysfunction often initiates ventricular arrhythmias, which in turn accelerates events towards heart failure and then sudden cardiac death ( 13 ). \\n myocardial fibrosis presents one of the major challenges clinically not just to improve the survival rate and also the quality of life. cardiac magnetic resonance ( cmr ) \\n has been useful in measuring the extent of diffuse myocardial fibrosis, which is considered as a common pathological pathway that leads to the loss of myocardial function ( 4,5 ). inasmuch as fibrosis can be reversible ( 6 ), its quantification using cmr can be useful in changing the way the cardiac fibrosis patients are monitored and treated ( 7 ). \\n myocardial fibrosis has been demonstrated in the pressure - loaded left ventricle of infants and children with aortic stenosis and coarctation ( 8). \\n histological studies revealed right ventricular myofiber disorganization and interstitial fibrosis in patients with tetralogy of fallot ( 9 ). \\n right ventricular fibrosis is not just found in late adult survivors, but actually is already present in infants suffering with this condition ( 10 ). \\n alterations in myocardial architecture associated with fibrotic remodeling lead to deranged heart function in different ways. \\n thus, in patients after tetralogy of fallot repair, fibrous endocardial thickening of the right ventricular infundibulum is a predictor of poor right ventricular function ( 5 ). on the other hand, \\n myocardial fibrosis is associated with systolic ventricular dysfunction early in life in patients with tricuspid atresia ( 11 ). \\n healthy myocardium consists of mostly cardiomyocytes ( ~75% ), with the remaining partition, the interstitium regions comprising of fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and coronary arteries ( 12 ). \\n the fibroblasts participate in the continuous formation and degradation of ecm, which is composed of types i and iii collagen fibers, that act as the scaffold for the myocardium. \\n disturbances in the balance between collagen production and degradation in the ecm, that led to expansion of collagens, cause myocardial fibrosis. \\n such derangement occurs either due to the death of cardiomyocytes, or because of stimuli that trigger elevated collagen synthesis ( 13 ). \\n i ) reactive interstitial fibrosis ( rif ) : this is characterized by an increase in collagen synthesis without much effect on the viability of myocardium ( 14 ). \\n rif is considered as a type of myocardial remodeling and leads to an increased interstitial compartment volume without any associated changes in myocyte volume. \\n this type of fibrosis is associated with diffused deposition of collagen and occurs in response to increased pressure and/or volume loads as in the cases of hypertension, aortic stenosis, chronic regurgitation, and shunt, ischemia, hyperglycemia, or ageing. \\n rif, which generally presents with a progressive chronic course, is possibly reversible by curtailing the damage causing stimuli or even by targeted therapy. \\n ii ) replacement fibrosis : an increased type i collagen deposition and expansion of ecm, following cardiomyocyte death contributes to this type of fibrosis ( 14 ). \\n the elevated levels of collagen fibers replace the dead cardiomyocytes, but lack the contractile and electric functionality. acute or chronic conditions that trigger cardiomyocyte death such as myocardial ischemia and events that damage the cardiomyocyte membrane integrity causing cell death, lead to diffused or focal replacement fibrosis. \\n unlike the rif, in replacement fibrosis, the affected myocardium is not viable and thus is unable to recover contractile properties following revascularization or by blocking the damaging process. \\n iii ) infiltrative interstitial fibrosis : this fibrosis is seen in conditions such as amyloidosis or anderson - fabry disease ( 14 ). \\n inflammatory cell infiltration was proposed to be an important factor underlying the interstitial fibrosis seen in right ventricles of systemic sclerosis - associated pulmonary arterial hypertension ( 15 ). \\n iv ) endomyocardial fibrosis ( emf ) : emf affects children under age of 2 years in tropical and subtropical regions, and involves the apical endocardium of either or both right and left ventricles. it has been suggested that emf as one of the primary causes of pediatric congestive heart failure, which is often overlooked clinically ( 16 ). \\n there is no clear etiology for emf, but hypereosinophilia, infections, autoimmunity, genetic factors and nutritional deficiencies may play a role. \\n emf has been described to present in three phases : initial phase of acute carditis with febrile illness and with heart failure in severe cases ; an intermediary subacute phase followed by a chronic burnt - out phase ( 17 ). \\n notably, emf is identified mostly at late stages of the disease and is not observed in the early phase of the disease. \\n however, following diagnosis, there is rapid onset of associated complications such as atrial fibrillation, thromboembolism and progressive atrioventricular valve regurgitation. \\n emf patients display clinical features of heart failure, with enlargement of both atria with normally functioning ventricles during echocardiography ( 18 ). \\n currently, the approach to treat emf patients is by surgery, involving targeted endocardial resection combined with valve repair or replacement, as there is no specific medical treatment ( 16 ). \\n although the biology of cardiomyocyte and its apoptotic or necrotic death have been the focus of several investigations addressing cardiac diseases, increasing evidence suggests cardiac fibroblasts in the pathogenic mechanisms ( 19,20 ). \\n fibroblasts, which are abundant in the normal myocardium, have a structural function by providing support ( 21 ). however, when these normally quiescent fibroblasts are activated, they transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, which appear similar to a hybrid of fibroblast and smooth muscle cells. myofibroblasts are able to effectively secrete and myofibroblasts are absent in healthy heart, they appear within days following a cardiac injury ( 22 ). \\n myofibroblasts appear as spindle - shaped and possess dendritic - like processes ( 23 ) that protrude from the cell body. \\n characteristic elongated and serrated nuclei, extensive areas of rough endoplasmic reticulum and irregular non - sarcomeric myofibrillar structures are morphological features of myofibroblasts as observed in electron micrographs of pressure - overloaded rat heart cross sections ( 24 ). \\n specific protein markers of myofibroblasts are mainly the ecm proteins, such as periostin, collagens i and iii and fibronectin ( 25 ). besides these ecm proteins, myofibroblasts also express smooth muscle -actin, sm22 and caldesmon ( 26,27 ). of note, \\n most of the myofibroblasts present in the border zone and approximately half of those in the fibrotic lesions of damaged myocardium, express embryonic smooth muscle myosin and -sma but not other smooth muscle markers, which is a major difference from smooth muscle cells ( 28 ). \\n it has been suggested that there are two stages in the transformation of myofibroblast : in the first stage, there is development of  proto - myofibroblasts from fibroblasts, with the characteristic formation of cytoplasmic actin stress fibers and small adhesion complexes, which facilitate the migration of these cells to the injured myocardium, where these cells secrete collagens and fibronectin and assume physical orientation in order to align themselves with the primary stress axes of the injured tissue ( 25 ). in the second stage, which starts approximately 2030 h following cardiac injury, the cytokines and mechanical stress convert these proto - myofibroblasts to mature myofibroblasts, which express -sma, which forms the stress fiber network ( 25 ). with further maturation of the myofibroblast, besides the -sma, cadherin-11 is also secreted and adds to the strength of the stress fiber network ( 29 ) ( fig. \\n 1 ). normally myofibroblasts have a protective function in the heart by participating acutely in injury repair response. \\n although uninterrupted fibrosis can be dangerous to heart, the function of myofibroblasts is important to maintain functional myocardium following any stress insult. \\n thus, following myocardial infarction, when cardiomyocytes die over several days due to ischemia, myofibroblasts play a major role in the remodeling of a fibrotic scar in the affected myocardium, in order to prevent wall rupture ( 30,31 ). \\n myofibroblasts eventually disappear, through less understood mechanisms, in many situations of wound healing. \\n one possible mechanism is that following the formation of permanent scar and stabilization of cardiac injury, which may take up to 2 weeks, a significant proportion of the myofibroblasts undergo senescence ( 32 ) and/or apoptosis ( 33 ). \\n it has also been proposed that some of the myofibroblasts may dedifferentiate back to fibroblast phenotype, even though strong evidence for this is lacking in myocardium. \\n critical for the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis is the persistent presence of myofibroblasts in the myocardium, long after the resolution of stress insult ( fig. \\n this is generally either due to concurrent dysregulation of neuroendocrine factors or even mechanical stress, both of which lead to and aggravate chronic cardiac fibrosis and/or hypertrophic scarring ( 34,35 ). a common example for this is the intermittent ischemia, chronically affecting the heart, creating constant wound healing milieu, which leads to persistent activation and formation of the myofibroblasts and the eventual fibrosis ( 30 ). \\n it has been proposed that the function of resident fibroblasts is to maintain normal tissue integrity and structure, whereas, acute injury or altered neuroendocrine signaling stimulates fibroblasts from other sources, which ultimately contribute to pathophysiologic fibrosis ( 36,37 ) \\n. a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in cardiac fibrosis and the regulation of the players involved such as myofibroblast formation and activation, is essential for developing effective therapeutics. \\n the most commonly employed techniques in patients with congenital heart disease to assess the fibrotic features of myocardium include stress echocardiography and cmr and also positron emission tomography ( pet ), which is the reference standard for monitoring myocardial viability. \\n stress echocardiography allows for the assessment of myocardial contractile reserve in patients with adequate acoustic windows. \\n because of this, the main limitation of stress echocardiography is decreased diagnostic accuracy in patients with poor acoustic windows ( 38 ). \\n pet scan is a nuclear scintigraphy and employs n - labeled ammonia, which a marker for coronary perfusion and f - fluorodeoxyglucose, a glucose surrogate, for monitoring myocardial metabolism. \\n a mismatch between the imaging of coronary perfusion and metabolism is indicative of nonviable tissue with the possibility of replacement fibrosis. \\n however, pet scanner availability is limited and its usage requires an on - site cyclotron, and pet is not sensitive enough to detect interstitial fibrosis ( 39 ). \\n cmr is able to provide much better spatial resolution and visualization of all myocardial segments, in the absence of any contaminating / interfering metallic particles, and this technique is used extensively for the quantitative assessment of ventricular size and systolic function. \\n there are two major cmr approaches for assessing myocardial fibrosis : late gadolinium enhancement ( lge ) imaging and t1 mapping / ecv fraction calculation. \\n lge identifies areas of discrete replacement fibrosis, with high sensitivity and specificity ( 13 ). \\n in the normal healthy heart, collagen network, which contributes to ecm and maintains myocardial architecture as well as chamber geometry, also provides tensile strength and elasticity, the necessary factors for normal systolic and diastolic function of ventricles ( 40 ). \\n several local and hormonal systems, such as renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system ( raas ), regulate the dynamic collagen turnover, and disturbances in these systems lead to an imbalance between collagen synthesis and degradation with the resultant accumulation of collagen, the underlying factor of cardiac fibrosis, followed by deranged myocardial architecture ( 41 ). \\n thus it has been shown that pharmacological intervention of raas could prevent this process of fibrosis and at times even reverse the damage caused ( 42 ). \\n thus, aldosterone antagonism with spironolactone has been found to lower collagen levels in hearts, ex vivo ( 43 ), improve diastolic function ( 44 ), decrease left ventricular size and ejection fraction ( 45 ), and also mortality ( fig. \\n 2 ) ( 46 ). there is ample evidence indicating increased expression of transforming growth factor- ( tgf- ) in response to injury and tgf- is known to play an important role during fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation, and also fibrosis ( fig. \\n 2 ) ( 47,48 ). tgf- acts via binding to its cell surface receptor, activin linked kinase 5 ( alk5 ), which phosphorylates smad2 and 3. \\n phospho - smad2 and 3 bind to smad4, which translocates into the nucleus, leading to the activation of target gene transcription. \\n it has been shown that inhibitors of alk5 signaling block certain steps of fibrosis process and thus there is a potential that alk5 can be a therapeutic target for cardiac fibrosis ( 49 ). even though neutralizing antibodies against tgf- have been tried in some studies ( 50 ), because of involvement of tgf- in several different cellular functions, such approach proved to be not appropriate ( 51 ) and alk5 antagonists are much better choice ( 52 ). \\n angiotensin ii has been shown to function in concert with tgf- in the signaling pathways that lead to cardiac fibrosis ( 53,54 ). \\n blockade of angiotensin receptor with inhibitors like losartan is effective in decreasing cardiac fibrosis in animal models and also in humans and this approach of angiotensin - ii inhibitors seems to be better than blocking tgf- ( 55 ). \\n similarly, antagonism of endothelin-1, which induces ecm production and myofibroblast transformation ( 56 ) was found to reduce cardiac fibrosis. \\n other possible therapeutic targets include platelet derived growth factor and connective tissue growth factor, ccn2, but further work is needed to ascertain this possibility ( 57 ). \\n cardiac fibrosis, which is seen in many types of heart diseases, involves increased accumulation of ecm, mediated by the activated myofibroblasts, arising from cardiac fibroblasts. \\n renin - angiotensin - ii - aldosterone system, tgf- signaling and alk5 have been found useful as therapeutic targets. \\n however, because of the importance of these pathways in many other physiological functions, their therapeutic targeting needs to be approached with caution.'},\n",

2  mm incision is made on lip mucosa near glandular salivary tissues. homeostasis after incision was provided simply with 15 minutes of external compression without a suture. minor salivary glands were fixed in formalin, processed, embedded in paraffin, stained with congo red, and examined by polarized light microscopy. in defined time period 37 biopsies were performed from 35 patients with suspected diagnosis of amyloidosis. in 2 patients the most common underlying disease was familial mediterranean fever followed by ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. the procedure was well tolerated in all patients without any major complication. in 11 patients amyloidosis was diagnosed with msgb ( table 2 ). of these 30 patients had biopsy from other sites : duodenum, bone marrow, rectum. or kidney. sixteen of them were identified as being of aa type and two were al type amyloidosis. systemic amyloidosis is a progressive and fatal disease unless diagnosed early and treated if possible. therefore, demonstration of amyloid accumulation within tissues is the only means of diagnosis of amyloidosis, making tissue biopsy essential. in our cohort hence, tissue biopsies can be obtained from any organ but amyloid deposits range from massive to subtle in these organs. urinary protein excretion, an early finding of amyloidosis, was regularly ordered in our department for screening of proteinuria which was the most common indication of msgb in our study. moreover, deposits may not be present in tissue biopsies from compromised organs like kidney and salivary glands. all these may explain low sensitivity of msgb found in our study compared to other studies that report 83 to 100% sensitivity [ 2, 9, 16 ]. since minimally invasive msgb method is well tolerated it can be repeated sometime later after the initial procedure. we repeated msgb 6 months after the first biopsy in two patients which confirmed the diagnosis of amyloidosis in one of them. the major drawback of minimally invasive msgb is that the amount of tissue obtained is relatively small [ 8, 12 ]. in our cohort the amount of salivary tissue was adequate for the histopathologic examination in all patients without major complications. the advantages of minimally invasive msgb method are avoidance of more invasive methods, need for a small incision, any prerequisite for the procedure, quite low risk of bleeding and nerve damage, applicability in an outpatient setting, and rapid healing [ 1, 12 ]. local and transient swelling, numbness, and pain were the only reported untoward effects by the patients related to the procedure. a substantial number of our patients had fmf as underlying disorder which is somewhat different from other geographic regions [ 10, 16 ]. however, we do not think that it is a major concern since the mechanism leading to amyloidosis is persistent inflammation as observed in other rheumatic diseases. tissue biopsies other than msgb were not routinely performed in all patients ; therefore, we could not compare sensitivity and specificity of msgb with other biopsy sites. msgb is a safe and simple method for the evaluation of amyloidosis which can be performed in an outpatient setting without preparation for procedure. we suggest extensive use of this minimally invasive method with consideration of its own drawbacks such as dependence of pathologists'skill and patients'amyloid load.\"},\n",

gauge ppv for grade c pvr - associated rd repair.7,10,1316 despite anatomic success and overall visual improvement in both groups , functional data demonstrate less encouraging results . \\n sixty - six percent of the valved eyes and 84% of the nonvalved eyes remained with 20/200 or worse bcva at the final follow - up , which is consistent with the previously reported studies on eyes with pvr - associated rd.13,15 in a previous study , we did not identify differences in outcomes or complications with valved versus nonvalved cannulas for a heterogeneous rd population of simple and complex detachments.17 however , we hypothesized that altered intraocular fluidics associated with valved cannulas may modulate the outcome of pvr - associated complex rd repair . decreased intraocular fluid currents with valved cannulas may result in reduced rpe seeding and less recurrent pvr . \\n alternatively , the reduced egress of fluid through valved cannulas may hinder washout of inflammatory proteins , debris , and cells , resulting in higher rates of recurrent pvr . \\n however , for both functional and anatomic outcomes , the study found no measurable difference between valved and nonvalved cannulas . \\n there were trends toward improved outcomes with valved cannulas in this study , and it is possible that this study was not adequately powered to detect this difference . \\n iatrogenic retinal breaks may be a complication of vitrectomy , and reported incidences range from 1.6% to 6.2%.1820 one etiology for iatrogenic retinal breaks is vitreous incarceration , which can occur due to vitreous attraction to open cannulas.2123 the stable fluidics of valved cannulas offers a potential for decreased attraction of vitreous incarceration into the cannulas , which has been shown experimentally in the eyes of rabbit.24 in our series , no case of vitreous incarceration at the cannula site was reported in either group , but it is possible that a larger series will elucidate a difference . \\n the improved stability of intraocular fluidics with valved cannulas requires adjustments to certain surgical approaches . \\n owing to the closed system fluidics of valved cannulas , venting must be performed when injecting additional volume such as silicone oil or pfo . \\n a chimney or a second instrument to displace one of the valve leaflets was used to vent the eye when inserting silicone oil with valved cannulas , whereas with nonvalved cannulas , a cannula was simply left open . \\n typically , slow injection of pfo is sufficient to avoid significant iop rise with both valved and nonvalved cannulas , as the infusion line can allow retrograde flow of fluid ( but not air ) , but if optic nerve perfusion was compromised , temporary pausing of the injection was performed . \\n dual - bore injection cannulas may also be used to avoid iop rise secondary to pfo injection,25 but were not used during the time of this study . while the methods of administration of these agents were similar between valved and nonvalved cannula groups , differences in fluidics may result in important differences in outcomes or complications that were undetected by this study . \\n this is a retrospective study whose data are limited by what was recorded in the medical record . \\n there was a significantly longer follow - up time in the nonvalved group , whose study period was 1 year prior to the valved group , which may bias the nonvalved group toward worse anatomic outcomes . \\n the study times of the two groups were temporally distinct , and although the baseline characteristics and surgical approaches of the two groups were not different , there may have been differences in variables that were not analyzed . on the other hand , these distinct study periods \\n may also reduce selection bias from surgeon preference or based on preoperative characteristics , as choice of valved vs nonvalved cannula use was not at the surgeon s discretion but rather a result of an institutional shift from the use of nonvalved to valved cannulas . \\n this is the first series that specifically evaluated valved vs nonvalved ppv for grade c pvr - associated rd . \\n no differences in functional or anatomic outcomes as well as complication rates were identified between the ppv of valved and nonvalved cannulas . in our opinion \\n , advantages of valved cannulas , including minimal egress of fluid during instrument exchange and associated stable intraocular fluidics , translate into easier and more controlled surgery with equivalent anatomic outcomes in complex grade c pvr rd without measurable increase in complication rates . \\n future studies should focus on improving functional visual results in grade c pvr -

gauge systems have been increasingly adopted in the management of a variety of vitreoretinal conditions, only limited knowledge exists regarding their impact on outcomes and complications of complex pathologic conditions such as grade c pvr - associated rd. to our knowledge, the present study is the only series specifically investigating valved cannulas for the repair of rd complicated by pvr. we show statistically equivalent visual improvement, single surgery success, final anatomic success, as well as complication rates with valved vs nonvalved ppv. \\n the study population consists of eyes with complex rd associated with grade c pvr presenting to a tertiary referral center. there is a correspondingly high proportion of recurrent rds and macula off detachments associated with poor preoperative vision and poor anatomic and functional prognosis. in this series, repair with valved cannulas was performed 1 calendar year following nonvalved cannulas, but both groups had comparable baseline demographics and preoperative characteristics. \\n anatomic outcomes of this study, with single surgery success of 83% vs 77% and final anatomic success of 94% vs 87% in valved vs nonvalved eyes, respectively, compare favorably to the literature of traditional 20-gauge ppv as well as the available data on small - gauge ppv for grade c pvr - associated rd repair.7,10,1316 despite anatomic success and overall visual improvement in both groups, functional data demonstrate less encouraging results. \\n sixty - six percent of the valved eyes and 84% of the nonvalved eyes remained with 20/200 or worse bcva at the final follow - up, which is consistent with the previously reported studies on eyes with pvr - associated rd.13,15 in a previous study, we did not identify differences in outcomes or complications with valved versus nonvalved cannulas for a heterogeneous rd population of simple and complex detachments.17 however, we hypothesized that altered intraocular fluidics associated with valved cannulas may modulate the outcome of pvr - associated complex rd repair. decreased intraocular fluid currents with valved cannulas may result in reduced rpe seeding and less recurrent pvr. \\n alternatively, the reduced egress of fluid through valved cannulas may hinder washout of inflammatory proteins, debris, and cells, resulting in higher rates of recurrent pvr. \\n however, for both functional and anatomic outcomes, the study found no measurable difference between valved and nonvalved cannulas. \\n there were trends toward improved outcomes with valved cannulas in this study, and it is possible that this study was not adequately powered to detect this difference. \\n iatrogenic retinal breaks may be a complication of vitrectomy, and reported incidences range from 1.6% to 6.2%.1820 one etiology for iatrogenic retinal breaks is vitreous incarceration, which can occur due to vitreous attraction to open cannulas.2123 the stable fluidics of valved cannulas offers a potential for decreased attraction of vitreous incarceration into the cannulas, which has been shown experimentally in the eyes of rabbit.24 in our series, no case of vitreous incarceration at the cannula site was reported in either group, but it is possible that a larger series will elucidate a difference. \\n the improved stability of intraocular fluidics with valved cannulas requires adjustments to certain surgical approaches. \\n owing to the closed system fluidics of valved cannulas, venting must be performed when injecting additional volume such as silicone oil or pfo. \\n a chimney or a second instrument to displace one of the valve leaflets was used to vent the eye when inserting silicone oil with valved cannulas, whereas with nonvalved cannulas, a cannula was simply left open. \\n typically, slow injection of pfo is sufficient to avoid significant iop rise with both valved and nonvalved cannulas, as the infusion line can allow retrograde flow of fluid ( but not air ), but if optic nerve perfusion was compromised, temporary pausing of the injection was performed. \\n dual - bore injection cannulas may also be used to avoid iop rise secondary to pfo injection,25 but were not used during the time of this study. while the methods of administration of these agents were similar between valved and nonvalved cannula groups, differences in fluidics may result in important differences in outcomes or complications that were undetected by this study. \\n this is a retrospective study whose data are limited by what was recorded in the medical record. \\n there was a significantly longer follow - up time in the nonvalved group, whose study period was 1 year prior to the valved group, which may bias the nonvalved group toward worse anatomic outcomes. \\n the study times of the two groups were temporally distinct, and although the baseline characteristics and surgical approaches of the two groups were not different, there may have been differences in variables that were not analyzed. on the other hand, these distinct study periods may also reduce selection bias from surgeon preference or based on preoperative characteristics, as choice of valved vs nonvalved cannula use was not at the surgeon s discretion but rather a result of an institutional shift from the use of nonvalved to valved cannulas. \\n this is the first series that specifically evaluated valved vs nonvalved ppv for grade c pvr - associated rd. no differences in functional or anatomic outcomes as well as complication rates were identified between the ppv of valved and nonvalved cannulas. in our opinion, advantages of valved cannulas, including minimal egress of fluid during instrument exchange and associated stable intraocular fluidics, translate into easier and more controlled surgery with equivalent anatomic outcomes in complex grade c pvr rd without measurable increase in complication rates. future studies should focus on improving functional visual results in grade c pvr - associated rd.'},\n",

infiltration of peripheral nerves by amyloid can be a cause of carpal tunnel syndrome and other sensorimotor mono- and polyneuropathies ; hyperviscosity may lead to headache, fatigue, visual disturbances, retinopathy, dementia ( 5, 6 ), and cerebral infarction ( 7, 8). however, one bears in mind that multiple myeloma may be present with a neurological disease. \\n hyperviscosity is defined on the basis of the relative viscosity of serum as compared with water. whereas normal relative serum viscosity is 1.8, \\n symptoms of hyerviscosity occur at a level of 5 to 6, a level usually reached at paraprotein concentrations of approximately 40 g / l for igm, 50 g / l for igg3, and 70 \\n hyperviscosity occurs relatively infrequently in patients with multiple myeloma, but one study reported an incidence of 4.2% among patients with igg protein ( 10 ). \\n its occurrence has been ascribed to the presence in the serum of high molecular weight polymers of the igg proteins. in our case, \\n major neurologic deficits occur in more than 25% of patients with myeloma and hyperviscosity syndrome ( 10 - 12 ). \\n lethargy, hemiparesis, seizures, coma, and acute confusional states are most frequently cited. \\n we reported a 68-yr - old patient who developed monoplegia of the left leg as the first manifestation of multiple myeloma with hyperviscosity. \\n this case was rare in that it involved plasma cell leukemia with cerebral infarction associated with serum hyperviscosity. \\n we searched for cases of multiple myeloma with hyperviscosity presenting with cerebral infarction, and found only 2 reports ( 13, 14 ). \\n clinical conditions in which this possible role of hyperviscosity in cerebral infarction could be demonstrated have not been reported so far. in another reported cases of cerebral infarction in multiple myeloma, \\n our case had no significant atherosclerotic lesion on intra- and extracranial vessels, and no risk factors of stroke except old age. \\n therefore, we suggest that hyperviscosity plays a key role in the pathogenesis of stroke in her with multiple myeloma, our case then, is consistent with the hypothesis that chronic blood hyperviscosity antedates the onset of symptomatic cerebrovascular disease. \\n thus, in patients with multiple myeloma, the monitoring of plasma viscosity was of major importance in order to evaluate the risk of cerebral infarction and decide the management for the prevention of stroke. \\n we believe that our patient represents a rare case of igg multiple myeloma associated with blood hyperviscosity and cerebral infarction. \\n based on our case study, and a review of the literature, we suggest that markedly elevated level of serum globulin in a patient with cerebral infarction requires measurement of blood viscosity, especially in patients with multiple myeloma.'},\n",

\\n evolution of concentration of anthocyanins present in \\n the pomegranate juice obtained by squeezing of fruit halves with \\n an electric lemon squeezer and stored for 72 hours at \\n 4c . \\n the levels of major anthocyanins detected in pome - granate juices obtained through two different extraction methods , \\n centrifugation of seeds or squeezing of fruit halves with an \\n electric lemon squeezer , and stored at 4c over 72 hours \\n are presented in figures 1 and 2 . \\n no \\n significant differences in the composition of anthocyanins were \\n detected among the treatments . in both cases , \\n the main \\n anthocyanin was dp3 , followed by dp3,5 , cy3,5 , and cy3 . \\n the \\n anthocyanins detected in our analysis of the assaria pomegranate \\n juices were as identified in other cultivars ; however , \\n concentrations of the individual pigments differed . \\n colour is one of the most important parameters when making a \\n sensorial evaluation of food quality . \\n no significant \\n differences were observed between the colours of juices obtained \\n through various extraction methods . at the extraction time , the \\n assaria juice colour was noted as 53a , according to the munsell \\n colour chart . \\n the bright colour of pomegranate fruit and juice is due to \\n anthocyanins , so their stability through juice processing is of \\n major importance . \\n the anthocyanin content in both extraction \\n methods was similar as was the respective evolution profile over \\n time . during the first 5 hours of storage at 4c , a \\n slight increase ( 0.3%4% ) in the amounts of each anthocyanin \\n was registered , followed by a decrease in the next ten hours and \\n then stabilisation occurred . \\n additionally , the fruit juice \\n obtained by centrifugation of seeds showed a pronounced decrease \\n of cy3,5 , mainly after 48 hours of storage \\n ( figure 1 ) . \\n it was reported previously that in \\n pom wonderful pomegranate \\n juices the diglucoside anthocyanins were \\n more stable than the monoglucosides , therefore the high \\n decrease of cy3,5 observed in our experiment was unexpected . \\n evolution of concentration of organic acids present in \\n the pomegranate juice obtained by seed centrifugation and stored \\n for 72 hours at 4c . \\n evolution of concentration of organic acids present in \\n the pomegranate juice obtained by squeezing of fruit halves with \\n an electric lemon squeezer and stored for 72 hours at \\n 4c . \\n evolution of sugar concentration in the pomegranate \\n juice obtained by seed centrifugation and stored for 72 hours at \\n 4c . \\n evolution of sugar concentration in the pomegranate \\n juice obtained by the squeezing of fruit halves with an electric \\n lemon squeezer and stored for 72 hours at 4c . \\n evolution of titrable acidity as percentage of citric \\n acid in the pomegranate juices obtained by centrifugation of \\n seeds and by the squeezing of fruit halves with an electric lemon \\n squeezer and stored for 72 hours at 4c . \\n the main organic acids present in the pomegranate juices were \\n oxalic and tartaric acids , either in juices obtained by seed \\n centrifugation or by squeezing of fruit halves , respectively \\n ( figures 3 and 4 ) . \\n these results were quite \\n different from those reported by others [ 6 , 13 ] for 11 \\n spanish pomegranate cultivars in which citric acid was the main \\n organic acid , sometimes followed closely by malic acid . \\n oxalic \\n and tartaric acids were present only in small amounts . in \\n contrast , a great variation in the organic acid composition among \\n the turkish pomegranate cultivars has been reported \\n . \\n citric and malic acids were predominant in the majority of \\n varieties , but in some cultivars large amounts of oxalic and \\n tartaric acids were detected . in those varieties , \\n the \\n evolution profiles of organic acids over time in juices \\n obtained through application of both methods were quite similar , \\n with only a few exceptions . a decrease of each organic acid during \\n the first 515 hours of cold storage \\n was observed , followed by \\n an increase reaching the maximal values after 32 hours of storage . \\n at this point , the levels of oxalic acid were of 292.9 and \\n 271.1  mg / l and those of tartaric acids were of 228.9 and \\n 228.0 \\n mg / l in juices obtained by seed centrifugation and \\n squeezing of fruit halves , respectively . the exceptions \\n reported above were malic , maleic , and citric acids in the samples \\n obtained by squeezing the fruits , and ascorbic acid in those \\n obtained through application of both methods \\n ( figure 4 ) . \\n the concentrations of malic and citric \\n acids reached the maximum after 15 hours of storage . \\n the ascorbic acid content remained quite stable over the whole \\n storage period independently of the method application . \\n the   main carbohydrates detected in the pomegranate juices were \\n glucose and fructose ( figures 5 and 6 ) . \\n only traces of sucrose were found and \\n therefore sucrose was not considered in the present work . \\n the \\n amounts of glucose and fructose were quite similar in juices \\n obtained through application of both methods . \\n a pronounced \\n decrease of total carbohydrate content of about 50% was observed \\n in juices independently of the extraction method after 5 hours of \\n storage at 4c . \\n it can be assumed that the decrease \\n of sugar and organic acids content during the first 15 hours of \\n storage occurs due to de novo synthesis of anthocyanins , whose \\n level increased exactly at the same time in juices obtained \\n through both methods . \\n evolution of brix of pomegranate juices \\n obtained by centrifugation of seeds and by the squeezing of fruit \\n halves with an electric lemon squeezer and stored for 72 hours at \\n 4c . \\n evolution of ph of pomegranate juices obtained by \\n centrifugation of seeds and by the squeezing of fruit halves with \\n an electric lemon squeezer and stored for 72 hours at \\n 4c . \\n titrable acidity showed a clear decrease after 32 hours of \\n storage when juice was obtained by centrifuging the seeds , that \\n was less marked in the juice extracted by squeezing fruits \\n ( figure 7 ) . \\n the level of sugars measured as \\n brix changed over time but the main feature was the \\n sharp decrease after 15 hours until the   end of the experiment in the seed centrifugation \\n procedure ( figure 8) . \\n this behaviour may be related \\n to the different chemical composition of juices due to the \\n presence of tannins as a result of rind cell damage during fruit \\n squeezing . \\n the presence of tannins is the main problem when \\n juices are   extracted from   whole fruits . as a result \\n , a bitter \\n taste develops that must be corrected by industrial processing \\n . in our experiment , according to panelist evaluation of \\n the fresh juices , the juice obtained by fruit squeezing showed a \\n bitter taste in comparison to the sweet taste of the juice \\n obtained by centrifuging seeds . \\n the ph presented a slight increase over time , more pronounced \\n from 5 to 15 hours after extraction ( figure 9 ) . \\n there \\n were no differences in ph related with the method used for juice \\n extraction . \\n this could partially explain the relative stability \\n of anthocyanins found in the juices obtained by both extraction \\n methods . \\n both methods used for pomegranate juice extraction did not \\n affect the evaluated characteristics of juice quality ; namely , the \\n anthocyanins content , the juice colour , the organic acids and \\n sugars composition , as well as the ph values . squeezing unpeeled \\n  fruit halves is the most economical and easy method to use . \\n the \\n juice obtained by that method was more stable over time as \\n indicated by the titrable acidity and brix \\n determinations . \\n the main disadvantage of the squeezing method is \\n the production of juice with bitter taste if additional \\n treatments are applied . \\n besides , the bitterness could be \\n overcome because the actual trend in juice production is the \\n blending of several fruit juices . \\n additionally , the use of \\n assaria pomegranate in fruit juice mixtures will be \\n beneficial for human health in reducing the riskfrom oxalic acid consumption .',\n",

treated mice ( fig . \\n we then tested glut4 promoter function under etomoxir treatment using a line of transgenic animals that carry the cat reporter gene expressed under the control of an 895-bp fragment of the human glut4 promoter ( 895-hg4-cat ) ( fig . \\n we have previously demonstrated that this fragment of the human glut4 promoter is sufficient to direct tissue - specific and regulated expression of the cat gene in a manner that is identical to endogenous mouse glut4 ( 16 ) . to this end \\n , cat and endogenous glut4 mrna levels were measured in brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue , hindquarter skeletal muscle , and heart tissue . \\n the effects of etomoxir treatment on cat gene expression and endogenous glut4 gene expression were highly tissue specific . \\n cat mrna and glut4 mrna levels in brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue were decreased ( p < 0.05 ) in both male and female mice ( fig . \\n in contrast , cat mrna and glut4 mrna in hindquarter skeletal muscle and heart were unaffected by etomoxir treatment ( fig . \\n the 2- to 3-month -

specific knockouts of the insulin receptor , several studies have shown that glut4 protein is not decreased in adipose tissue , skeletal muscle , or cardiac tissue ( 18,26,27 ) . to check whether the transcriptional regulation of the glut4 gene was changed by the absence of insulin receptor signaling , we made use of the cardiac - specific receptor knockout of the insulin receptor ( cirko ) model . \\n the cirko - hg4-cat mice were evaluated for their level of cat and endogenous glut4 mrna expression using the rnase protection assay . \\n cat and glut4 mrna expression appear to be unchanged with the loss of an intact insulin receptor ( fig . \\n effect of the loss of insulin signaling on cat and glut4 transcription in cardiac tissue . a : hearts from cirko -

labeled probes to the 3 untranslated region of cat and glut4 . \\n the insulin receptor does not directly regulate the levels of cat and glut4 mrna . because etomoxir treatment inhibits fatty acid import into mitochondria , we reasoned that a signal to the glut4 promoter might be mediated through the putative lxre on the human glut4 promoter . \\n lxr signaling promotes fat storage ; therefore , we reasoned that changes in fat oxidation could be sensed through this signaling pathway ( 28 ) . to test this hypothesis \\n , we generated a line of transgenic mice carrying a loss of function mutation in the lxre site in the context of the 895-hg4-cat transgenic construct . \\n this new mutant construct ( -lxr - cat ) was used to generate two founder lines of mice . \\n both founder lines expressed transgenic mrna in the glut4-expressing tissues , but restricted expression in tissues that do not normally express glut4 ( data not shown ) . from this , we conclude that the lxre site was not required for a tissue - specific expression pattern of the transgene . to determine the role of lxre in mediating the downregulation of glut4 mrna under etomoxir treatment , we calculated the ratio of cat mrna to glut4 mrna in white and brown adipose treatment in both lines of transgenic mice ( fig . \\n the ratio of cat to glut4 remained the same because cat and glut4 mrna were downregulated to the same extent with etomoxir . \\n in contrast , the ratio of cat mrna to glut4 mrna doubled with etomoxir treatment in adipose tissues from animals carrying the -lxr - cat construct ( fig . \\n b : the 2- to 3-month - old transgenic mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg / kg body wt of etomoxir . after 18 h , \\n total rna was isolated from white adipose tissue ( wat ) and brown adipose tissue ( bat ) from each control and etomoxir - treated mice . \\n qrt - pcr was used to determine mrna levels of cat , glut4 , and actin . \\n * significant difference between control ( con ) and etomoxir - treated ( eto ) ( p < 0.05 ) . to determine \\n if etomoxir downregulates glut4 through changes in the hormones or other systemic factors other than insulin , we treated 3t3-l1 adipocytes with etomoxir overnight and measured glut4 mrna ( fig . \\n 5a ) . similar to adipose tissue in vivo , etomoxir treatment downregulates glut4 mrna in 3t3-l1 adipocytes about fourfold . to determine if the etomoxir - induced changes were due to inhibition of long - chain fatty acid import , we sought to restore glut4 mrna by providing palmitoyl - l - carnitine . \\n etomoxir - treated cells were further treated without or with 1 mmol / l palmitoyl - l - carnitine to bypass carnitine - palmitoyl - transferase activity . \\n 5b ) , confirming that the major effect of etomoxir was due to inhibited formation of acyl carnitines . \\n 3t3l1 adipocytes ( days 68 post -

l - carnitine ( plc ) in hepes - buffered saline , ph 7.4 , was added to etomoxir - treated cells . \\n total rna was isolated and qrt - pcr was used to determine mrna levels of glut4 and actin . \\n * significantly different from control ( con ) ( p < 0.05 ) . in transgenic animals , \\n the signal to downregulate glut4 mrna was mediated , in part , through the lxre of the glut4 promoter . \\n to further elucidate lxre function , we expressed either a luciferase promoter driven by the human glut4 promoter ( 895-hg4-luc ) or the construct carrying the loss - of - function mutation in the lxre ( -lxr - hg4-luc ) in 3t3-l1 adipocytes . \\n mutation of the lxre site resulted in a highly reproducible and statistically significant decrease in reporter expression ( fig . \\n expression of -lxr - hg4-luc decreased no further upon etomoxir treatment , suggesting that effects of etomoxir treatment are mediated , in part , through lxr signaling . to determine if the lxre element was bound by lxr protein , we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using an antibody raised against lxr-. lxr- specifically bound the glut4 promoter in control 3t3-l1 adipocytes ( fig . \\n quantification of three independent experiments revealed that etomoxir reduced binding by 84% compared with control cells ( see fig . \\n a : 3t3l1 adipocytes ( day 5 post -

pcr . \\n bars with different lowercase letters are significantly different from one another ( p < 0.05 ) . con , control . \\n to understand the nature of the signaling pathway coupled with long - chain acyl carnitine formation , we sought to determine the signaling pathway to activate to restore glut4 mrna . because the lxre element was required for downregulation , we treated cells with the lxr agonist to901317 ( calbiochem ) . \\n treatment with to901317 partially restored glut4 mrna to a level that was not statistically lower than control ( fig . \\n 7a ) . to determine if to901317 treatment influenced lxr binding to the glut4 promoter , we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using control and etomoxir cell extracts without and with treatment with to901317 . \\n treatment of both control and etomoxir - treated cells with to901317 significantly enhanced lxr binding to the glut4 promoter ( fig . \\n this suggests that occupancy of the lxre domain with lxr ligand is required for full activation of glut4 gene expression , but that lxre ligand occupancy is not rate - setting for glut4 transcription . \\n we have demonstrated that acute inhibition of lcfa import into mitochondria results in a tissue - restricted downregulation of glut4 gene transcription in adipose tissue , but not in skeletal muscle or heart tissue ( fig . \\n recently , several laboratories have provided evidence supporting a model for dysregulation of lipid metabolism as a cause of insulin resistance ( 23,29,30 ) . \\n these papers invoke several mechanisms including increased levels of ceramide ( 30 ) , increased levels of the signaling and biosynthetic intermediate diacylglycerol ( 29 ) , and reduced capacity for mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids ( 23 ) as the cause of insulin resistance . because the level of glut4 expression may play a role in chronic insulin resistance , it seems likely that changes in lipid metabolism could regulate glut4 transcription and contribute to downregulation of glut4 mrna . \\n we reasoned that inhibition of mitochondrial lcfa might also play a role in generating a metabolic signal leading to regulation of glut4 transcription . \\n we observed that the acute inhibition of mitochondrial lcfa inhibited glut4 transcription in white and brown adipose tissue , but did not alter transcription in skeletal muscle or heart ( fig . \\n this suggests that inhibition of lcfa import , per se , does not directly inhibit glut4 transcription , but rather the fate of the imported lcfa in a given tissue may generate a signal to the glut4 promoter . \\n therefore , the effect of etomoxir on adipose tissue reveals a unique function for mitochondrial lcfa import in this tissue . in our model , \\n intracellular triacylglycerol accumulated in liver and heart tissue , but not skeletal muscle ( fig . \\n this was unexpected , since previous studies showed that etomoxir treatment in rats led to increased triacylglycerol in skeletal muscle ( 31 ) . \\n the different findings in the c57bl/6 mice used in this study compared with rats suggest a species or strain - specific difference in fatty acid metabolism . \\n for instance , the c57bl/6 mice may have increased secretion of free fatty acids and triacylglycerol from skeletal muscle or decreased uptake of free fatty acids from adipose tissue and liver . \\n nonetheless , the accumulation of triacylglycerol in heart tissue did not correlate with a downregulation of glut4 transcription , suggesting that these events are not directly linked . \\n this is somewhat surprising to us , since increased triacylglycerol levels in hearts of mice with a cardiac - specific overexpression of lipoprotein lipase correlated with decreased glut4 mrna levels ( 32 ) . \\n that study might reflect a chronic adaptation to continued high levels of triacylglycerol in those transgenic mice . in humans and rodents , \\n diabetes and obesity lead to downregulation of glut4 gene transcription in adipose tissue ( 19,3335 ) . \\n downregulation of adipose glut4 in diabetes and fasting are consistent with the notion that glut4 transcription is regulated by decreased insulin signaling , increased counterregulatory hormone secretion , or the concomitant changes in substrate flux that accompany both insulin resistance and fasting ( 34,36 ) . \\n for example , during insulin resistance and fasting , insulin signaling is reduced , insulin - mediated glucose flux is low , and circulating fatty acids are high . insulin resistance and fasting have similar effects on adipose tissue metabolism , including increased lipolysis with release of fatty acids and glycerol that is used for hepatic gluconeogenesis ( 37 ) . \\n on the other hand , insulin resistance states and fasting have different effects on substrate utilization in skeletal muscle . \\n fatty acid oxidation is inhibited in insulin resistance , while it is quite active in fasting ( 22,23,38 ) . in muscles of obese and type 2 diabetics , glucose oxidation in the fasted state in \\n much higher than lean controls , and there is little or no difference in fatty acid oxidation between the fed and fasted states ( 38 ) . \\n we have now used a metabolic paradigm that incorporates aspects of both enhanced glucose utilization of plasma glucose levels and decreased lipid utilization to examine the effects on glut4 expression . \\n etomoxir - treatment inhibited -oxidation by inhibiting cpt-1 activity and lowered blood glucose levels ( fig . \\n previous studies in rats have shown that etomoxir treatment lowers insulin levels , but does not necessarily lead to lipolysis , since the fat mass was reported to be increased and circulating free fatty acids not elevated ( 31 ) . in the current study \\n 1c ) nor camp levels ( data not shown ) were altered under etomoxir treatment . \\n nevertheless , the glut4 transcription levels in both brown and white adipose tissue were reduced under etomoxir treatment consistent with a shift away from glucose utilization in adipose tissue , thereby increasing its availability for other organs . \\n although we have not shown it directly , it is unlikely that the downregulation of glut4 transcription in adipose tissue is due to low levels of signaling through the insulin receptor . \\n first , the adipose - specific knockout of the insulin receptor does not alter glut4 protein expression ( 18 ) . \\n second , we demonstrated that glut4 transcription in heart is not altered by cardiac - specific knockout of the insulin receptor ( fig . \\n 3 ) . while we did not find that etomoxir led to changes in cardiac glut4 gene expression , the findings that insulin receptor signaling is not required for glut4 transcription in the cardiac tissue is evidence that other signals likely regulate the glut4 promoter . \\n the differences in transcription likely reflect differences in the physiologic and metabolic roles that each of these tissues play . in adipose tissue , glut4 may be playing a role in energy sensing , whereas in muscle tissue , glut4 may play a more important role in fuel selection . \\n this is supported by evidence that glut4 knockout mice oxidize fatty acids at a significantly higher rate than wild - type mice ( 39,40 ) . moreover , \\n skeletal muscle and adipose tissue respond differently to activation of amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) . in skeletal muscle , ampk activation leads to increased glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation presumably to increase atp levels , while in adipose tissue , ampk activation inhibits these processes , presumably allowing free fatty acids to be released from adipocytes for use in other tissues ( 41,42 ) . in part \\n , the effects of ampk on skeletal muscle metabolism may be mediated through increased glut4 gene transcription in muscle ( 43,44 ) . \\n glut4 transcription is regulated by metabolic changes that are associated with insulin resistance , but might not be directly regulated by insulin action per se . \\n we demonstrated that the effects of etomoxir ( in vivo and in vitro ) are mediated , in part , by lxr signaling ( figs . 4 , 6 , and 7 ) . the glut4 promoter regulatory region contains an lxre site , which we have now confirmed binds to the lxr- ligand both in adipose tissue , and 3t3-l1 adipocytes ( figs . 6 and 7 ) . \\n similar to insulin , lxr signaling promotes the synthesis and storage of lipids ( 28 ) . \\n it is quite reasonable that lxr signaling would support production of glut4 mrna during times when lipid storage in adipose tissue is required . \\n etomoxir treatment reduced lxr- association with the glut4 promoter , consistent with the conclusion that lxr plays a positive role in glut4 gene transcription through the lxre . \\n replenishment of etomoxir - treated cells with either palmitoyl l - carnitine , the product of cpt-1 enzyme , and lxr agonist each restored glut4 expression to near - normal levels , suggesting that mitochondrial import of long - chain fatty acids may play in regulating lxr signaling in the adipocyte . \\n this effect of lxr activation was present in cultured cells , suggesting that systemic factors are not involved . \\n conversely , fatty acid oxidation may indirectly produce a lxr ligand . in hepatic cells , lxr may function as a glucose sensor by directly binding glucose or glucose-6-phosphate to induced lxr - dependent transcriptional activation ( 45 ) . \\n finally , inhibition of fatty acid oxidation may lead to increased ampk activation in adipose tissue , as is observed in fasted adipocytes ( 46 ) , which in turn leads to decreased glucose uptake , lipogenesis , and fatty acid oxidation ( 41 ) . in hepatic tissue , ampk activation has been shown to suppress lxr - dependent gene transcription presumably through alterations in ligand production . \\n in fact , changes in lxr signaling may be part of the transition between the fed and fasted state in adipose tissue and show that lxr is responding to glucose flux in adipose tissue . \\n lxr signaling may play a role in the adaptation to the metabolic stress that accompanies over - nutrition and diabetes . \\n for example , treatment of obese insulin - resistant c57bl/6 mice with an lxr agonist improved glucose homeostasis ( 48 ) . \\n future work is underway to determine the role of lxr signaling to the glut4 promoter in states of relative insulin deficiency .\",\n",

rats average , in turn derived from a beat - by - beat average over the four - hour recordings for each time period for each subject . \\n the results show that prior to conversion ( top - left panel ) to the diabetic state ( i.e. , control , dark blue ) blood pressure was high at p0 , was lower at p1 , and rose to a peak at p2 and then fell again at p3 . \\n a similar circadian pattern was recorded for the onset of diabetes at day 0 ( panel a , maroon ) and again at day 21 ( yellow ) . by day 60 ( light blue ) \\n the peak diurnal blood pressure was shifted to period p3 ( 124  pm ) while the night time peak increased ( p5 ; 97.4  5.2  mmhg ) . \\n the circadian bp rhythms for diabetic duration 35 months are shown in figure 2(b ) ( top - right panel ) . \\n the diurnal peak of bp remained at p3 at 90 days ( maroon ) and 120 days ( yellow ) while the nighttime peak was still at p5 . at 150 days ( light blue ) peak diurnal \\n bp was at p2 ; however bp at p4 fell below the early morning dip at p1 . \\n the pattern of circadian changes in bp appeared to normalize later in diabetes , but the amplitudes of the changes are greatly reduced especially in the p3 to p4 period ( figure 2(c ) ) . \\n the diabetes - resistant rats bbdr showed no appreciable shifts in the diurnal peak period over the study period . \\n circadian changes in heart rate ( figure 3 ) followed a pattern similar to that of mean arterial pressure . prior to conversion and at day 0 heart rate was high at p0 followed by a dip at p1 and increasing to a peak at p2 ( figure 3(a ) , top - left ) . \\n however from day 21 to day 90 the peak shifted to midafternoon at p3 . beyond day 150 \\n there was a return to normal pattern with a dip at p1 and peak at p2 , another dip at p3 , and gradual rise to p4 and p5 in the night ( figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) ) . \\n the cross - correlation coefficient of heart rate and blood pressure   in the diabetic animals in the six time periods looks  parabolic  with p0 and p5 having the highest values ( p0 : 0.65  0.031 ; p5 : 0.68  0.019 ) , while the periods p3 and p4 had the lowest values ( 0.49  0.036 , 0.50  0.04 , resp . ) in the control recording ( figure 4(a ) ) . \\n the cross - correlation coefficient was elevated relative to control at p1 and p2 at the onset of diabetes ( i.e. , day 0 , maroon ) . by days 21 and 60 \\n there was a midday peak at p2 with dips at p1 and p3 showing a change in pattern . \\n the late diurnal coefficient showed little or no change from p3 to p5 at diabetic age 120150 days ( figure 4(b ) ) . with an increase in diabetic age the amplitude of the variation in cross - correlation coefficient across the 24-hour day \\n was reduced by day 244 , but overall values remained high . however , by the 9th month the cross - correlation coefficient fell significantly with a peak at p2 and lowest dip at p5 ( 0.39  0.06 ) ( figure 4(c ) ) suggesting impairment or degeneration of integrative functions . \\n in contrast the nondiabetic control rats maintained a higher cross - correlation coefficient and did not manifest a dip at p5 ( bbdr : 0.65  0.03 , p < .05 versus bbdp , 0.39  0.06 ) .  \\n figure 5 shows the effect of diabetic age on the circadian cross - correlation coefficient in the diabetic rats . \\n note that , in the pre - conversion period ( i.e. , n14 to n1 ) , there was considerable daily fluctuation in the cross - correlation coefficient ( 0.46 to 0.69 ) . \\n after conversion the range of the daily fluctuation narrowed , and by day 21 all the periods had converged ( 0.6 to 0.67 ) ; thereafter ( day 60 to day166 ) the cross - correlation coefficient again showed a wide circadian fluctuation which was sometimes higher than the pre - conversion values . around day 244 \\n this reduction was steady and continued as the cross - correlation coefficient started to decline by day 273 . \\n the graph shows that apart from the daily rhythm , there is also a long - term periodic cycle of about one - month duration exhibited by this parameter . \\n this fairly regular pattern was diminished later ( from day 180 ) in the diabetes . \\n the lead / lag times of the cross - correlation between hr and bp in the circadian period of the diabetic rats are shown in figure 6 . \\n the negative values of the lead / lag plot indicate that heart rate changes led blood pressure changes by the indicated value ( in sec . ) . in the pre conversion period \\n the values for the night and early morning periods ( p0 , p1 , p4 , and p5 ) were generally higher ( 2.0 to 2.3 sec ) while those for midday ( p2 and p3 ) were lower ( 1.6 to 2.0 sec ) . \\n however about day 21 in the postconversion period there was a change in the trend with the continued reduction of the nighttime lead values , especially between day 21 and day 90 . \\n there was gradual reduction in the lead / lag time for the various periods as the diabetes progressed ; however , by day 244 the diurnal circadian variation was significant with p0 ( nighttime ) having the highest lead ( 2.0  0.06 sec ) while p3 ( afternoon ) had the lowest ( 1.45  0.07 sec ) . \\n when the changes were aggregated ( figures 7(a ) and 7(b ) ) the average cross - correlation coefficients of the peak ( figure 7(a ) ) and nadir ( figure 7(b ) ) showed less fluctuation in the control diabetic - resistant rats suggesting that the between group differences are not primarily due to maturation . \\n results from this study in an animal model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes mellitus are associated with changes in resting circadian cardiovascular and autonomic functions . \\n it is also established that central suprachiasmatic nucleus and related structures act as circadian pacemakers for the whole body [ 24 , 25 ] . \\n the interplay of the central and peripheral oscillators enables the organism to adjust the activities of its organs to maximize efficiency while functioning optimally in a changing environment . \\n our results show that at the onset of diabetes up to the 3rd diabetic week blood pressure had two peaks at midnight / morning , and midafternoon , interlaced with a dip in the morning and followed by another dip late afternoon . \\n in this longitudinal study a phase shift was seen by the 2nd diabetic month in which the diurnal blood pressure peak shifted from midafternoon to late afternoon ( p3 ) . \\n this new pattern was sustained to the third and fourth months of the duration of diabetes . \\n the prediabetic pattern of blood pressure changes was displayed beyond the fifth month , but the amplitude of the rhythm was reduced . \\n the cross - correlation coefficient of heart rate and blood pressure showed wide circadian variation in the pre - conversion period , and the amplitude of the rhythm reduced in the postconversion period and showed little or no fluctuation in the late afternoon - night section during the third to the fifth diabetic month . a sharp fall in the cross - correlation coefficient followed in the 9 - 10th month with reduction of the diurnal range . \\n our results suggest that there is also a seasonal rhythm of oscillation in cross - correlation coefficient with a periodicity of about sixty days . \\n the lead time of the peak lead / lag plot of the cross - correlation coefficient was negative throughout the study showing that heart rate change was leading blood pressure change . \\n this value diminished with diabetic age but did not overturn , suggesting that sympathetic efferent control of the cardiovascular system was maintained , but with reduction in effectiveness . \\n the diurnal rhythm showed that the heart rate lead over blood pressure was longer in the morning period ( p1 ) before and at onset of diabetes . \\n the combination of the spontaneously diabetic rat model and telemetry has proven advantageous for this long - term longitudinal study of the circadian cardiovascular and autonomic function in diabetes . \\n our findings are consonant with earlier reports of time - dependent alterations in heart rate , circadian variation , pulse pressure , and cardiac autonomic control in streptozotocin- ( stz- ) treated rats [ 18 , 26 , 27 ] . \\n young et al .   have also reported alteration of internal circadian clock in the heart of stz - treated rats . \\n the former were acute studies or intermittent - duration studies lasting one day , 8 weeks , and ten weeks , respectively , and some used indwelling arterial cannula for blood pressure measurement . \\n to the best of our knowledge the present study is unique because we not only measured continuous prediabetic data , but we also recorded during the diabetic conversion period and , thereafter , continuous , long - term cardiovascular function . \\n our observations reveal that there is yet another rhythmic long - term variation of cardiovascular function . \\n this rhythm has a periodicity of about sixty days which is not obvious in diabetes - resistant rats . \\n the mechanisms underlying the reported changes in cardiovascular function were thought to be in the heart and/or neuroendocrine control . \\n it has been recognized that stz - induced alterations of the circadian clock of the heart may be independent of diabetes development . \\n our results do not show a dramatic change in heart rate at onset of diabetes . \\n this is in contrast with the severe bradycardia of about 20%   and 30%   in earlier reports that used stz . \\n other reports on isolated cardiac preparations have associated stz diabetes with depression of basal spontaneous pacemaker rate [ 2931 ] , which was not affected by nadolol or atropine [ 31 , 32 ] . \\n it was thought that changes in electrophysiological properties of the sinoatrial ( sa ) node of the heart , such as maximum diastolic potential , threshold , or slope of diastolic depolarization , were responsible . \\n this may be due to central effect(s ) on cardiovascular system via the autonomic nervous system . \\n we have applied computational cross - correlation coefficient analysis of the changes in heart rate and blood pressure to the circadian rhythm and the long - term variability of heart rate and blood pressure in these animals . \\n this method has been shown to be advantageous for investigating dynamic arterial blood pressure and heart rate control [ 21 , 33 ] . \\n this method revealed different changes in circadian rhythms at different times in the development of diabetes . in the control period the circadian rhythm consisted of a unipodal curve with a peak in the night and a dip in the midday . \\n immediately at conversion to diabetes the circadian rhythm showed a sustained peak of the cross - correlation coefficient into the mornings . \\n however by the second month the relationship changed to a bipodal curve with peaks in the night and midday and dips in the morning and afternoon . \\n the cross - correlation coefficient remained positive indicating   that sympathetic control was maintained , though with fluctuations . \\n thus it can be surmised that in this period permanent damage to autonomic regulatory mechanisms may not have occurred , but some destabilization of the resting tone may be in place . in the ninth month we observed a significant reduction in cross - correlation coefficient and a phase shift in the peaks and dips with the nighttime having the lowest dip , and this did not occur in the diabetes - resistant rats . \\n this may mark the beginning of irreversible impairment of autonomic and cardiovascular function . in classic blood pressure driven changes as in baroreflex tests , haemorrhage and postural change , \\n bp change is followed reflexly by a compensatory change in hr yielding a negative cross - correlation with bp leading hr . while this is true for volume expansion , compartment reduction via vasoconstriction or vasodilation , this appears not to hold true for euvolemic and nonbaroreflex adjustments . in conclusion , \\n our observations show that in the development of diabetes the circadian cardiovascular rhythms show slight alterations , though these changes only became significant at the late stage of the disease . \\n this is consistent with impairment of integration and/or functional autonomic capacity in prolonged diabetes mellitus .',\n",

group difference in absolute weight, both groups exhibited similar growth patterns during the study period. \\n likewise, we reported   that baseline mean arterial pressure ( map ) did not differ between groups and that hr was minimally, but significantly, lower in the diabetic animals versus the controls for the first 6 months after the bbdp became diabetic. \\n one diabetic rat died about day 120 of diabetic duration and another at day 244. \\n figure 1 shows ten days of mean arterial pressure ( map ), hr, and light / dark cycles for a diabetes - resistant animal. \\n the circadian variations in blood pressure and heart rate are demonstrably out of phase with the light / dark rhythm ( i.e., lowest map and hr during light on ), as would be expected for an animal that is most active during the dark. \\n panels a, b, and c of figure 2 graph map recorded for the time periods p0 ( 12 midnight4  am ), p1 ( 4  am8  am ), p2 ( 8  am12 noon ), p3 ( 124  pm ), p4 ( 4  pm8  pm ), and p5 ( 8  pm12 midnight ) in the bbdp rats at the indicated days following their becoming diabetic. \\n each point is an across - rats average, in turn derived from a beat - by - beat average over the four - hour recordings for each time period for each subject. \\n the results show that prior to conversion ( top - left panel ) to the diabetic state ( i.e., control, dark blue ) blood pressure was high at p0, was lower at p1, and rose to a peak at p2 and then fell again at p3. \\n a similar circadian pattern was recorded for the onset of diabetes at day 0 ( panel a, maroon ) and again at day 21 ( yellow ). by day 60 ( light blue ) \\n the peak diurnal blood pressure was shifted to period p3 ( 124  pm ) while the night time peak increased ( p5 ; 97.4  5.2  mmhg ). \\n the circadian bp rhythms for diabetic duration 35 months are shown in figure 2(b ) ( top - right panel ). \\n the diurnal peak of bp remained at p3 at 90 days ( maroon ) and 120 days ( yellow ) while the nighttime peak was still at p5. at 150 days ( light blue ) peak diurnal \\n bp was at p2 ; however bp at p4 fell below the early morning dip at p1. \\n the pattern of circadian changes in bp appeared to normalize later in diabetes, but the amplitudes of the changes are greatly reduced especially in the p3 to p4 period ( figure 2(c ) ). \\n the diabetes - resistant rats bbdr showed no appreciable shifts in the diurnal peak period over the study period. \\n circadian changes in heart rate ( figure 3 ) followed a pattern similar to that of mean arterial pressure. prior to conversion and at day 0 heart rate was high at p0 followed by a dip at p1 and increasing to a peak at p2 ( figure 3(a ), top - left ). \\n however from day 21 to day 90 the peak shifted to midafternoon at p3. beyond day 150 \\n there was a return to normal pattern with a dip at p1 and peak at p2, another dip at p3, and gradual rise to p4 and p5 in the night ( figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) ). \\n the cross - correlation coefficient of heart rate and blood pressure   in the diabetic animals in the six time periods looks  parabolic  with p0 and p5 having the highest values ( p0 : 0.65  0.031 ; p5 : 0.68  0.019 ), while the periods p3 and p4 had the lowest values ( 0.49  0.036, 0.50  0.04, resp. ) in the control recording ( figure 4(a ) ). \\n the cross - correlation coefficient was elevated relative to control at p1 and p2 at the onset of diabetes ( i.e., day 0, maroon ). by days 21 and 60 \\n there was a midday peak at p2 with dips at p1 and p3 showing a change in pattern. \\n the late diurnal coefficient showed little or no change from p3 to p5 at diabetic age 120150 days ( figure 4(b ) ). with an increase in diabetic age the amplitude of the variation in cross - correlation coefficient across the 24-hour day \\n was reduced by day 244, but overall values remained high. however, by the 9th month the cross - correlation coefficient fell significantly with a peak at p2 and lowest dip at p5 ( 0.39  0.06 ) ( figure 4(c ) ) suggesting impairment or degeneration of integrative functions. \\n in contrast the nondiabetic control rats maintained a higher cross - correlation coefficient and did not manifest a dip at p5 ( bbdr : 0.65  0.03, p <.05 versus bbdp, 0.39  0.06 ).  \\n figure 5 shows the effect of diabetic age on the circadian cross - correlation coefficient in the diabetic rats. \\n note that, in the pre - conversion period ( i.e., n14 to n1 ), there was considerable daily fluctuation in the cross - correlation coefficient ( 0.46 to 0.69 ). \\n after conversion the range of the daily fluctuation narrowed, and by day 21 all the periods had converged ( 0.6 to 0.67 ) ; thereafter ( day 60 to day166 ) the cross - correlation coefficient again showed a wide circadian fluctuation which was sometimes higher than the pre - conversion values. around day 244 \\n this reduction was steady and continued as the cross - correlation coefficient started to decline by day 273. \\n the graph shows that apart from the daily rhythm, there is also a long - term periodic cycle of about one - month duration exhibited by this parameter. \\n this fairly regular pattern was diminished later ( from day 180 ) in the diabetes. \\n the lead / lag times of the cross - correlation between hr and bp in the circadian period of the diabetic rats are shown in figure 6. \\n the negative values of the lead / lag plot indicate that heart rate changes led blood pressure changes by the indicated value ( in sec. ). in the pre conversion period \\n the values for the night and early morning periods ( p0, p1, p4, and p5 ) were generally higher ( 2.0 to 2.3 sec ) while those for midday ( p2 and p3 ) were lower ( 1.6 to 2.0 sec ). \\n however about day 21 in the postconversion period there was a change in the trend with the continued reduction of the nighttime lead values, especially between day 21 and day 90. \\n there was gradual reduction in the lead / lag time for the various periods as the diabetes progressed ; however, by day 244 the diurnal circadian variation was significant with p0 ( nighttime ) having the highest lead ( 2.0  0.06 sec ) while p3 ( afternoon ) had the lowest ( 1.45  0.07 sec ). \\n when the changes were aggregated ( figures 7(a ) and 7(b ) ) the average cross - correlation coefficients of the peak ( figure 7(a ) ) and nadir ( figure 7(b ) ) showed less fluctuation in the control diabetic - resistant rats suggesting that the between group differences are not primarily due to maturation. \\n results from this study in an animal model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes mellitus are associated with changes in resting circadian cardiovascular and autonomic functions. \\n it is also established that central suprachiasmatic nucleus and related structures act as circadian pacemakers for the whole body [ 24, 25 ]. \\n the interplay of the central and peripheral oscillators enables the organism to adjust the activities of its organs to maximize efficiency while functioning optimally in a changing environment. \\n our results show that at the onset of diabetes up to the 3rd diabetic week blood pressure had two peaks at midnight / morning, and midafternoon, interlaced with a dip in the morning and followed by another dip late afternoon. \\n in this longitudinal study a phase shift was seen by the 2nd diabetic month in which the diurnal blood pressure peak shifted from midafternoon to late afternoon ( p3 ). \\n this new pattern was sustained to the third and fourth months of the duration of diabetes. \\n the prediabetic pattern of blood pressure changes was displayed beyond the fifth month, but the amplitude of the rhythm was reduced. \\n the cross - correlation coefficient of heart rate and blood pressure showed wide circadian variation in the pre - conversion period, and the amplitude of the rhythm reduced in the postconversion period and showed little or no fluctuation in the late afternoon - night section during the third to the fifth diabetic month. a sharp fall in the cross - correlation coefficient followed in the 9 - 10th month with reduction of the diurnal range. \\n our results suggest that there is also a seasonal rhythm of oscillation in cross - correlation coefficient with a periodicity of about sixty days. \\n the lead time of the peak lead / lag plot of the cross - correlation coefficient was negative throughout the study showing that heart rate change was leading blood pressure change. \\n this value diminished with diabetic age but did not overturn, suggesting that sympathetic efferent control of the cardiovascular system was maintained, but with reduction in effectiveness. \\n the diurnal rhythm showed that the heart rate lead over blood pressure was longer in the morning period ( p1 ) before and at onset of diabetes. \\n the combination of the spontaneously diabetic rat model and telemetry has proven advantageous for this long - term longitudinal study of the circadian cardiovascular and autonomic function in diabetes. \\n our findings are consonant with earlier reports of time - dependent alterations in heart rate, circadian variation, pulse pressure, and cardiac autonomic control in streptozotocin- ( stz- ) treated rats [ 18, 26, 27 ]. \\n young et al.   have also reported alteration of internal circadian clock in the heart of stz - treated rats. \\n the former were acute studies or intermittent - duration studies lasting one day, 8 weeks, and ten weeks, respectively, and some used indwelling arterial cannula for blood pressure measurement. \\n to the best of our knowledge the present study is unique because we not only measured continuous prediabetic data, but we also recorded during the diabetic conversion period and, thereafter, continuous, long - term cardiovascular function. \\n our observations reveal that there is yet another rhythmic long - term variation of cardiovascular function. \\n this rhythm has a periodicity of about sixty days which is not obvious in diabetes - resistant rats. \\n the mechanisms underlying the reported changes in cardiovascular function were thought to be in the heart and/or neuroendocrine control. \\n it has been recognized that stz - induced alterations of the circadian clock of the heart may be independent of diabetes development. \\n our results do not show a dramatic change in heart rate at onset of diabetes. \\n this is in contrast with the severe bradycardia of about 20%   and 30%   in earlier reports that used stz. \\n other reports on isolated cardiac preparations have associated stz diabetes with depression of basal spontaneous pacemaker rate [ 2931 ], which was not affected by nadolol or atropine [ 31, 32 ]. \\n it was thought that changes in electrophysiological properties of the sinoatrial ( sa ) node of the heart, such as maximum diastolic potential, threshold, or slope of diastolic depolarization, were responsible. \\n this may be due to central effect(s ) on cardiovascular system via the autonomic nervous system. \\n we have applied computational cross - correlation coefficient analysis of the changes in heart rate and blood pressure to the circadian rhythm and the long - term variability of heart rate and blood pressure in these animals. \\n this method has been shown to be advantageous for investigating dynamic arterial blood pressure and heart rate control [ 21, 33 ]. \\n this method revealed different changes in circadian rhythms at different times in the development of diabetes. in the control period the circadian rhythm consisted of a unipodal curve with a peak in the night and a dip in the midday. \\n immediately at conversion to diabetes the circadian rhythm showed a sustained peak of the cross - correlation coefficient into the mornings. \\n however by the second month the relationship changed to a bipodal curve with peaks in the night and midday and dips in the morning and afternoon. \\n the cross - correlation coefficient remained positive indicating   that sympathetic control was maintained, though with fluctuations. \\n thus it can be surmised that in this period permanent damage to autonomic regulatory mechanisms may not have occurred, but some destabilization of the resting tone may be in place. in the ninth month we observed a significant reduction in cross - correlation coefficient and a phase shift in the peaks and dips with the nighttime having the lowest dip, and this did not occur in the diabetes - resistant rats. \\n in classic blood pressure driven changes as in baroreflex tests, haemorrhage and postural change, \\n bp change is followed reflexly by a compensatory change in hr yielding a negative cross - correlation with bp leading hr. while this is true for volume expansion, compartment reduction via vasoconstriction or vasodilation, this appears not to hold true for euvolemic and nonbaroreflex adjustments. in conclusion, \\n our observations show that in the development of diabetes the circadian cardiovascular rhythms show slight alterations, though these changes only became significant at the late stage of the disease. \\n this is consistent with impairment of integration and/or functional autonomic capacity in prolonged diabetes mellitus.'},\n",

2 ) this expression increased significantly with adipocyte differentiation in association with lipogenic ( fasn , acc , pparg ) and adipogenic ( adipoq ) genes ; 3 ) metformin ( 5 mmol / l ) blunted the adipocyte differentiation of human preadipocytes in parallel to decreasing significantly the expression of proinflammatory mediators ; 4 ) blocking metformin action using cimetidine reversed these effects ; and 5 ) in ex - vivo experiments , metformin led to decreased adipogenic and proinflammatory gene expression . \\n to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study evaluating metformin effects and oct1 gene expression in human adipocytes . \\n the increased oct1 gene expression in stromo - vascular cells compared with adipocytes suggests that metformin action on stromo - vascular cells might contribute to systemic effects . \\n considering the importance of oct1 in the metformin response ( 9 ) , we suggest that the higher oct1 gene expression in obese subjects is behind the increased metformin effects in these subjects . \\n interestingly we found that baseline oct1 gene expression was associated with the metformin - induced adipogenic gene expression reduction ( acc1 , adipoq , fasn and ppar ) , suggesting that the higher the oct-1 gene expression , the higher the effects of metformin . \\n the inhibitory effects of metformin on adipogenesis have been previously shown in the 3t3-l1 cell line ( 1113 ) via ampk activation . however , to our knowledge , these actions have not been explored in human preadipocytes . in the current study , metformin ( 5 mmol / l ) \\n significantly decreased the expression of adipogenic ( fasn , acc , pparg , adipoq ) genes and the formation of lipid droplets , increasing ampk activity ( ampk and consequently acc1 ) . \\n the adipocyte differentiation ( increasing lipogenic gene expression and decreasing ampk activity ) was restored dose - dependently when the oct1 blocker agent cimetidine was used as a cotreatment . in agreement with our data , the response to metformin \\n was inhibited in mice models in which the oct1 gene was deleted ( oct1 ) . \\n subjects carrying a single nucleotid polymorphism associated with a decrease in oct1 gene expression also showed decreased metformin effects ( 4,10,16 ) . importantly , metformin administration significantly decreased il-6 and mcp-1 gene expression in adipocytes and in adipose tissue explants . \\n recently , metformin has been shown to display anti - inflammatory effects in endothelial cells by inhibiting tnf-induced ikk/ phosphorylation , ikappab- degradation , and il-6 production ( 17,18 ) . \\n the mode of action of metformin has yet to be fully established . in muscle , liver , and endothelial cells , \\n the metabolic changes induced by metformin appear to be mediated by the amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) . \\n ampk acts as a sensor of the cellular energy status , being switched on by an increased atp demand or by processes that interfere with atp production such as ischemia . \\n the activated form of ampk switches on catabolic pathways while switching off atp - consuming processes ( 19 ) . \\n it has been reported that metformin binds to complex i of the mitochondrial respiratory chain , and this could in part explain how this drug acts ( 20 ) . \\n the inhibition of complex i would cause a decrease in energy supply that would in turn lead to a higher amp / atp ratio , and the concomitant activation of ampk . \\n however , although metformin has been associated with weight loss , glitazones lead to increased adipocyte differentiation and weight gain . metformin stimulates catabolic pathways in white adipose tissue through the activation of ampk , reducing the triglyceride stores as reflected by the smaller size of the adipocytes ( 13,21 ) . \\n these effects are achieved through an increase in lipolysis and -oxidation , which would imply that there is no release of fatty acids and that they are oxidized within the adipocyte . \\n other authors have described that metformin inhibited adipocyte differentiation ( using rat mesenchymal stem cells ) ( 22 ) . \\n we propose here that oct1 density in adipose tissue is a factor that can significantly influence all these effects of metformin . \\n furthermore , fisher et al . ( 14 ) have shown that metformin induces glucose uptake independent of insulin in subcutaneous and visceral human adipocytes . in conclusion , oct1 gene expression and protein levels \\n the increased oct1 gene expression in adipose tissue of obese subjects might contribute to increased metformin action in these subjects .\",\n",

       "  'model_output': 'the main findings of this study are : 1 ) oct1 gene expression was detectable in whole adipose tissue ( similarly in the subcutaneous and visceral fat depots ) and in isolated adipocytes ; 2 ) this expression increased significantly with adipocyte differentiation in association with lipogenic ( fasn, acc, pparg ) and adipogenic ( adipoq ) genes ; 3 ) metformin ( 5 mmol / l ) blunted the adipocyte differentiation of human preadipocytes in parallel to decreasing significantly the expression of proinflammatory mediators ; 4 ) blocking metformin action using cimetidine reversed these effects ; and 5 ) in ex - vivo experiments, metformin led to decreased adipogenic and proinflammatory gene expression. \\n to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating metformin effects and oct1 gene expression in human adipocytes. \\n the increased oct1 gene expression in stromo - vascular cells compared with adipocytes suggests that metformin action on stromo - vascular cells might contribute to systemic effects. \\n considering the importance of oct1 in the metformin response ( 9 ), we suggest that the higher oct1 gene expression in obese subjects is behind the increased metformin effects in these subjects. \\n interestingly we found that baseline oct1 gene expression was associated with the metformin - induced adipogenic gene expression reduction ( acc1, adipoq, fasn and ppar ), suggesting that the higher the oct-1 gene expression, the higher the effects of metformin. \\n the inhibitory effects of metformin on adipogenesis have been previously shown in the 3t3-l1 cell line ( 1113 ) via ampk activation. however, to our knowledge, these actions have not been explored in human preadipocytes. in the current study, metformin ( 5 mmol / l ) \\n significantly decreased the expression of adipogenic ( fasn, acc, pparg, adipoq ) genes and the formation of lipid droplets, increasing ampk activity ( ampk and consequently acc1 ). \\n the adipocyte differentiation ( increasing lipogenic gene expression and decreasing ampk activity ) was restored dose - dependently when the oct1 blocker agent cimetidine was used as a cotreatment. in agreement with our data, the response to metformin \\n was inhibited in mice models in which the oct1 gene was deleted ( oct1 ). \\n subjects carrying a single nucleotid polymorphism associated with a decrease in oct1 gene expression also showed decreased metformin effects ( 4,10,16 ). importantly, metformin administration significantly decreased il-6 and mcp-1 gene expression in adipocytes and in adipose tissue explants. \\n recently, metformin has been shown to display anti - inflammatory effects in endothelial cells by inhibiting tnf-induced ikk/ phosphorylation, ikappab- degradation, and il-6 production ( 17,18 ). \\n the mode of action of metformin has yet to be fully established. in muscle, liver, and endothelial cells, \\n the metabolic changes induced by metformin appear to be mediated by the amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ). \\n ampk acts as a sensor of the cellular energy status, being switched on by an increased atp demand or by processes that interfere with atp production such as ischemia. \\n the activated form of ampk switches on catabolic pathways while switching off atp - consuming processes ( 19 ). \\n it has been reported that metformin binds to complex i of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and this could in part explain how this drug acts ( 20 ). \\n the inhibition of complex i would cause a decrease in energy supply that would in turn lead to a higher amp / atp ratio, and the concomitant activation of ampk. \\n however, although metformin has been associated with weight loss, glitazones lead to increased adipocyte differentiation and weight gain. metformin stimulates catabolic pathways in white adipose tissue through the activation of ampk, reducing the triglyceride stores as reflected by the smaller size of the adipocytes ( 13,21 ). \\n these effects are achieved through an increase in lipolysis and -oxidation, which would imply that there is no release of fatty acids and that they are oxidized within the adipocyte. \\n other authors have described that metformin inhibited adipocyte differentiation ( using rat mesenchymal stem cells ) ( 22 ). \\n we propose here that oct1 density in adipose tissue is a factor that can significantly influence all these effects of metformin. \\n furthermore, fisher et al. ( 14 ) have shown that metformin induces glucose uptake independent of insulin in subcutaneous and visceral human adipocytes. in conclusion, oct1 gene expression and protein levels \\n the increased oct1 gene expression in adipose tissue of obese subjects might contribute to increased metformin action in these subjects.'},\n",

up put the children at risk of dka and other acute complications which can be life threatening. \\n poor follow - up and lack of access to service increase rate of hospital admission to treat acute complications. \\n lack of continuity of care and point of contact after hours are important factors in increasing hospital admission to treat dka in children and adolescents. \\n immediate and directed instructions for care giver of a child with early signs of dka can prevent its progression and avoid the need for hospital presentation and admission. \\n dka results from deficiency of circulating insulin and the combined effects of increased levels of the counterregulatory hormones : catecholamines, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone. \\n accordingly, education of early signs of dka and its management is of paramount importance to prevent and manage the condition. despite the improvement in diabetes management over the last decades, \\n their input is fundamental in establishing a center of excellence for quality management of diabetes in young people. \\n training nurses in the diabetes team to be competent trainers should take a priority when setting up a diabetes center. \\n initial training should be followed by regular updating which requires commitment by the trainees and the employers. \\n it is proven that ensuring high family education and competence in the disease management is associated with better control, reduction of acute complication, and improvement of emotional well - being. \\n patients should have access to a 24-hour telephone helpline managed by highly trained educators for emergency advice and treatment of dka. \\n experienced diabetes educators are valuable members of the diabetes team. we hypothesize that implementing a diabetes educator model of care for children and adolescents with diabetes reduces the frequency of hospital admission for dka. \\n information on the episodes on hospital admission for acute presentation of dka was searched for. \\n data was obtained through mafraq hospital health information system ( his ) from the medical records department. \\n obtained data were filtered to capture number of admissions for patients 18 years old and under who have established diabetes and were admitted with the diagnosis of dka. \\n venous blood ph was available in all patients included and reading below 7.3 was considered acidosis. \\n data requested was for admission in the year of 2009 and 2010 ( data point a ). \\n patients who were admitted with dka as a first sign of new diagnosis of diabetes were excluded. \\n the number of patients with a diagnosis of diabetes under the age of 18 and under follow - up in the outpatient clinic is also obtained ( data point b ). \\n the baseline measurement was taken as a ration of number of patients admitted for dka per total number of patients followed up in clinic a / b. \\n quarterly data of patients 18 years and under who were admitted for dka was obtained through each ward record. \\n a study team member is allocated on 3-month basis to collect the information and data is compiled in a shared folder used by study team members. \\n a paediatric diabetes clinic database is updated on 3-month basis to include all patients who are 18 years and under with the diagnosis of diabetes and are under regular follow - up in the diabetes clinic at the paediatric endocrinology department, mafraq hospital. \\n a yearly ration is calculated with the numerator consisting of number of patients admitted in dka and denominator of number of patients under regular follow - up at the diabetes clinic. \\n patients with diabetes who were admitted acutely for concurrent illnesses or other indications rather than dka were excluded. newly diagnosed patients with diabetes presenting with dka were also excluded. \\n as the measure was specific to our unit performance, patients who presented and were admitted with dka in our hospital but are not followed up in our outpatient department were excluded too. \\n four nurses who are employed to cover diabetes service in the hospital received intensive training to qualify as diabetes educators. \\n educators received special training on the use of technology in treatment of diabetes and were trained on research methodology, data management, and it related issues through enrollment in various management and it courses. \\n one diabetes educator was promoted as the paediatric diabetes service coordinator and was in charge of maintaining and updating the clinic database. \\n she also has the task of allocating patients to educators based onnumber of patients per educator, preferred gender of educator by family, language spoken, special interest of the educator in relation to treatment technology used per each patient. \\n number of patients per educator, preferred gender of educator by family, special interest of the educator in relation to treatment technology used per each patient. \\n each patient was allocated a named diabetes educator to be the first line to access of service and was provided with open access to diabetes clinic. \\n the role of the named educators included introduction of initial and ongoing patient education, setting up group education meetings, training patients at a high level on devices and equipment used to manage diabetes, and conducting awareness campaigns for diabetes. \\n patients and families were educated on the importance of patient - team collaboration to prevent and treat diabetes complication. \\n they were, also, engaged in various special education programs and involved in departmental surveys and feedback. \\n education on dka recognition, prevention, and management received a high priority in patients and family education. \\n educators used various audiovisual methods to explain the condition to patients who were given written and digital material for consolidating the knowledge they gain from education sessions. \\n patients are also trained on using blood and urine ketone strips to detect early signs of dka. \\n some patients had access to home blood ketone strips. regardless of the method of ketone detection, \\n all patients were instructed on the level at which management of ketosis should be started. \\n detailed instruction on how to avoid and treat dka has given special attention to patients on insulin pump therapy. \\n chi square test is performed to test the difference in admission rate through the study period. \\n adolescents with type 2 diabetes constituted around 5% and those with monogenic diabetes ( including various types of neonatal diabetes ) constituted another 5%. \\n over the study period, insulin pump use has increased to 50% in 2014 when half of the patients used insulin pumps and the other half was managed on multiple daily injections of insulin. \\n number of patients per educator increased from around 15 paediatric patients per educator at the start of study to approximately 90 patients in 2014. \\n more phone calls were received from patients on insulin pumps particularly during the first few days and weeks of pump insertion. \\n there was an obvious increase in phone call consultation over certain seasons of the year. \\n there were 158 admissions for dka in children and adolescents 18 years and under over a 5-year period ( 20092014 ). \\n a total number of patients followed up in the outpatient diabetes clinics ranged between 37331 patients from 2009 until 2014 ( table 1 ). \\n admission rate showed a downward trend over the five - year period ( figure 1 ). \\n ratio between admission episodes and outpatient case load showed a marked reduction from 2.1 in the baseline measurement year to an average of 0.16 over the next 4 years ( 20102014 ) with a ratio of 0.01 in the last year of the project ( 2014 ). \\n chi square test confirmed that the reduction in the admission rate is statistically significant with a p value of 0.001. \\n admission rate went from a 4.2-fold reduction for the second year after baseline measure to 210-fold reduction 4 years later ( p  0.001 ) ( table 1 ). \\n medical expenditure for this potentially preventable complication is substantial and imposes a large economic burden on the healthcare system [ 47 ]. despite substantial progress in overall diabetes management over the past few decades \\n it is estimated that the risk of dka in established type 1 diabetes patients can be up to 10% per patient per year. \\n our study showed that implementation of our diabetes care model has reduced the percentage of dka admission to 1.8%. \\n table 1 shows a steady reduction of the dka admission per year per 100 patients from 210, 51, 11, and 4.4 to 1.8 for years from 2009 to 2014. \\n hospital admission because of dka not only imposes large expenses on health care institute but disrupts the person's routine family life and leads to school and work absence. as the incidence of dka remains high, its associated hospitalization remains high, too. \\n curtis et al. showed that over one - third of hospital admissions in children younger than 19 years with type 1 diabetes are due to dka. \\n proper education and regular follow - up reduce the possibility of this complication and its resulting hospitalization. adapting a diabetes educator care model offers patients direct access to support and first - hand troubleshooting advice \\n well trained diabetes educator can be the first on - call team members in threating emergencies and can guide patients to proper management to avoid a complication like dka. \\n diabetes centers caring for children and adolescents must be equipped with highly trained diabetes educators who can provide a high quality specialized education which will empower patients and families for self - management and provide required support to manage threatening emergencies. \\n many barriers are known leading to delay in diagnosing dka. of those, there are difficulty in distinguishing cases of dka from other illnesses, information overload, and ling period from initial diagnosis. \\n such barriers remain a major obstacle in prevention of dka in children even in developed countries with active prevention campaigns. \\n some groups of patients are known to be of high risk to develop dka and intensive education to prevent this complication should be provided [ 18, 19 ]. \\n our project results proved the importance of training the trainers to deliver the required level of skills and education to the patient ( end - user ). \\n it showed the importance of establishing a multidisciplinary team in treating a chronic disease like diabetes and minimizing dka as an acute and possibly life threatening condition. \\n although training diabetes educators to a high level is expensive, it remains cost - effective when putting the cost of admission for dka into consideration. \\n specialist nurses / diabetes educators are not widely available specialists. employing nurses and training them to the level of diabetes educators incur a high cost and stretch institutions'budgets. \\n implementing of various patient education programs and preparing unified education material impose time and effort constraints. to accomplish an improvement in the primary end point of reduction hospital admission due to dka, various devices and expensive ketone - detecting strips \\n further limitations in prevention of dka are that some patients are not fully insured and many insurers do not cover diabetes management accessories. in search of diabetes youth study, lack of private health insurance was found to be a risk factor in development of dka. \\n implementing and sustaining the diabetes care model can be hard to achieve in institution with limited resources. \\n in addition, other factors could contribute to the decrease in dka, for example, changing the modality of treatment or the insulin regime, increased general improvement of care, and the increase in general awareness of diabetes. in conclusion, \\n proper guidance on prevention of dka avoids hospital admission and saves a considerable cost and hospital resources. \\n more importantly, it will empower children and families to self - management and boost their confidence in preventing and treating complications and emergency situation related to diabetes. \\n our project shows that establishing a diabetes educator care model in managing young people with diabetes is an effective and a sustainable measure to prevent hospital admission of dka. \\n out of hours hotline telephone access is a major factor for preventing admission for dka. \\n it is not an uncommon condition with an estimated risk of up to 10% per patient per year. \\n management of established dka needs admission in a specialized center and imposes major constraints on hospital resources. \\n provision of patient education program which includes direct access of care during and after hours can reduce the risk of dka and minimize the need for hospital admission. \\n we have proposed a model of care led by diabetes educators for children and adolescents with diabetes. \\n the model consists of a package of service for the patient that relies predominantly on structured education and provision of continuity of care and direct access to service. \\n we have measured the effectiveness of the implemented model by comparing the rate of hospital admission for dka over 4-year period compared to the baseline year prior to implementing the model. \\n we have shown a statistically significant reduction in the admission rate for dka during the study period. the ratio of the number of admissions to the number of patients followed up in the diabetes outpatient clinic reduced from 2.1 to 0.01 which is equivalent to 210-fold reduction. \\n we conclude that diabetes educator care model is an effective and a sustainable measure way to reduce hospital admission for dka.\\n\\n### Author Note:\\nno potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.\"},\n",

In terms of diet to prevent heart disease, it is useful to avoid excess fried foods and red meat. Lean meat like chicken and fish are beneficial.

       "  'input': 'Hello doctor,Four months ago, I consulted you on this platform for premature complexes which I was having without any other symptoms. Below is my query and your answer - I am a male of 48 years of age. I have a lean build and do regular exercise. Since childhood, I had a tendency for heart palpitations and premature beats. After a few tests, anxiety was found to be the main cause.  You had said that most probably these premature complexes are originating from ventricles which are leading to the symptoms. These are usually benign and not life threatening. The only concern remains is that of coronary artery disease, which is also less likely as these are occurring from a long time and you are not having any other symptoms. Lack of sleep, stress, alcohol, smoking, caffeinated beverages are known triggering factors for these due to sympathetic overactivity. You should also get thyroid test done. I think, just be on a safer side, you should get one treadmill test done to rule out coronary artery disease and echo should be repeated. Afterwards, I met a cardiologist and got an ECG and echo tests done. The tests were normal. The cardiologist said that there is no need for TMT test since I do running and other exercises daily and there is no known risk factor for CAD. But the VPCs continued for a month.Then, I realized that I was taking a weight gainer supplement from the last one year which contained creatinine. Two months back, I was not doing any exercise due to a small fracture in my elbow but continued to take this supplement. The doctor advised me to stop the supplement immediately since this could be the cause of missed beats. Then I read in the internet and found out that there have been cases of irregular heart beats due to creatinine supplementation. I stopped taking the supplement although it was from a reputed firm and did not contain any steroids. The missed beats reduced after stopping the supplement and from the last two months, it has come to a normal level of one or two in a day. But somehow my mind started getting preoccupied with the thoughts of heart disease and I started reading about it from the internet and even textbooks.I have been thin and slim since my childhood, have been quite active physically, no family history of heart disease, no diabetes, no hypertension, non-smoker, rarely eat fried foods. My lipid profile is normal with HDL being about 55 whenever tested, CRP is around 0.5. But in spite of this, I was not able to free my mind from worries of CAD. A month back, I did quite a lot of pushups after a gap of four to five months. After three to four days, I started having pain in my chest here and there mostly at rest. After a week I got an ECG done which was normal. The pain subsided slowly but whenever I did some exercise which put a strain on the chest muscle I started having pain and with pain, more worries.Then I met a psychiatrist. He said that I have got into an obsessive loop, which is part of health anxiety disorder which is causing these psychosomatic symptoms of chest pain. He advised me to take some antidepressants for three months, do Yoga and meditation and take some sessions of cognitive behavior therapy. I am reluctant to take antidepressants but have already started doing some meditation and Yoga. He also prescribed Alprazolam .25 mg on SOS basis. Now the pain is subsiding slowly and obsessive thoughts are also reducing. I have stopped doing any exercise that would put a strain on the chest. I do not know how long it will take to resume it. In a recent blood test, two months back my vitamin D3 was at 28. Could it be the cause of the chest pain? Secondly, I stopped the supplement but continued some strenuous exercises without taking a proper diet. Could it be the cause of it? Please guide me. How to get rid of this unwanted health anxiety which I have got into?',\n",

If you have a burning sensation or feeling urgency to void the bladder, it indicates an infection. So, get your urine test done along with fasting blood sugar.

The first thing I would want to know is whether you are taking any medications for your frequent urination. If you are not on any medications, then you should avoid caffeine, alcohol and fizzy drinks. Also, you should increase your water intake. If you are on any medications, then you should consult your doctor to see if the medications are causing this problem.

Especially when there is no adequate insulin and glucose levels are higher than 300 to 350 mg. It is necessary to take adequate water to eliminate those through urine. Avoid exercise when ketones are present. Try and maintain closer to normal glucose levels. Check glucose levels at home more often (every 3 to 4 hours). There is no mention of what is the treatment with the dosage of various  ChatDoctor.  You have to bring glucose in better control to prevent ketones developing.

Fatigue is a common problem that can be caused by a variety of factors, including physical inactivity, poor sleep habits, stress, and certain medical conditions. It is important to evaluate the underlying cause of fatigue in order to develop an appropriate treatment plan. In your case, it is possible that your fatigue is related to the side effects of your antipsychotic medications. However, it is also possible that your fatigue is due to other factors, such as stress or poor sleep habits. It is important to discuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of your fatigue and develop an appropriate treatment plan. In addition to addressing the underlying cause of fatigue, it is also important to make lifestyle changes that can help reduce fatigue, such as engaging in regular physical activity, getting enough sleep, and managing stress through techniques such as meditation or deep breathing exercises. It is also important to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these substances can contribute to fatigue. In terms of treatment, your healthcare provider may recommend medications or other interventions to address the underlying cause of your fatigue. It is important to follow your healthcare provider's instructions and attend all follow-up appointments to ensure that you are receiving the appropriate treatment. If you have any questions or concerns about your fatigue or treatment plan, please do not hesitate to discuss them with your healthcare provider.\"},\n",

If you have diabetes or hypertension that may be a cause of this detachment. It can also happen in vitreous hemorrhage in which you will see a slightly reddish vision and will not clear up. If this is the case, then it will clear up in few weeks. What is the exact cause can be told only on examination. You should rush to the emergency asap. If detachment surgery is required then visual prognosis depends on the time elapsed between episode and surgery. So, you should not delay. There is not much you can do at the moment by yourself.

For people with diabetes, fasting can be challenging due to the potential risks of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. However, with proper planning and monitoring, it is possible to fast safely for people with diabetes. Before fasting, it is important to discuss your plans with your healthcare provider to ensure that it is safe for you and to develop a fasting plan that meets your needs. During fasting, it is important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly and to be prepared to treat any hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia that may occur. It is also important to stay hydrated and to consume foods that are high in protein and healthy fats to help stabilize your blood sugar levels. After fasting, it is important to gradually reintroduce foods into your diet to avoid any potential complications. Overall, fasting can be a safe and healthy practice for people with diabetes, but it is important to approach it with caution and to work closely with your healthcare provider to ensure that it is done safely.'},\n",

       "  'input': 'Hello doctor,Six months ago, following a mild concussion, I started to have symptoms that were vaguely consistent with bilateral cervical radiculopathy. The cervical MRI showed severe stenosis and disc herniation at the C6-7 level going right and C5-6 going left. The worst symptoms were numbness, tingling, and weakness down the left arm. These symptoms really did not follow the C5-6 dermatome, however. They were all over the place in the left arm.Six months later, the numbness and tingling have resolved. I feel stronger overall. However, I have had body-wide fasciculations for four months. And I can see wasting of the first dorsal interossei muscle of the left hand. It is subtle, but I notice it. I have trouble holding a pot or a phone with elbow bent past 90 degrees.I have seen two neurologists including one neuromuscular specialist at an academic center. Both EMGs were clean. They needed the dorsal interossei muscle and all the other major muscles of the left arm. Clinical exams were also normal though benign fasciculations were noted. How do I know that I do not have ALS? What are the chances that these fasciculations are benign given the perceived weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations (body-wide)? How long does it take after the beginning of atrophy for an EMG to pick up ALS? What else could this be? Would not it be odd to develop ulnar neuropathy, worsening rotator cuff issues and bodyside fasciculations at the same time? I am not a doctor, but these seem like system wide problems.Currrently, I am taking Lamictal, Zaleplon and Lipitor.',\n",
       "  'output': 'Hi,  Welcome to ChatDoctor. It is highly unlikely that the EMGs (electromyography) are clean in the presence of muscle wasting and fasciculations. I believe the symptoms and signs you are experiencing are due to cervical stenosis and not due to ALS. A C6-7 disc herniation can cause all the symptoms you have described. Is it possible for you to upload the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) pictures? In ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), usually, EMG findings precede clinical symptoms such as fasciculations and muscle wasting. This is also the case in radiculopathy due to cervical stenosis.  Take care.',\n",
       "  '__index_level_0__': 26154,\n",
       "  'model_output': 'Dear Patient, Thank you for your question. I have reviewed your case and I understand your concerns. You have been experiencing fasciculations and some mild wasting of the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the left hand. I am glad to hear that the numbness and tingling have resolved. I am not sure if you have seen a physical therapist, but if you have not, I would recommend that you see one. They can help you with strengthening exercises and can also help you with some of the issues that you are experiencing with your elbow. As far as the fasciculations and wasting, it is not uncommon for patients to develop fasciculations and wasting without the presence of ALS. There are other neurologic disorders that can cause fasciculations and wasting such as multifocal motor neuropathy. However, it is not possible to diagnose ALS without a lumbar puncture and electromyography (EMG). An EMG is an electrical test that is used to evaluate the function of the muscles and the nerves. The lumbar puncture is a test that is used to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is important to note that an EMG can be normal in the early stages of ALS. The EMG may not pick up ALS until the muscles are weak and the nerves are damaged. The EMG can also be normal if the ALS is in the early stages and the nerves are not yet damaged. It is also important to note that ALS can affect any part of the body, not just the arms and legs. It is not possible to determine if you have ALS without a lumbar puncture and an EMG. However, it is important to note that you have been experiencing some mild wasting and fasciculations. These are not uncommon in patients with ALS. However, it is not possible to determine if you have ALS without a lumbar puncture and an EMG. I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions.'},\n",

Each time, the embryo failed to develop more than four days, once developed only up to morula stage on day five. My wife is 30 years old with AMH 4.5 with type-2 diabetes. Next, what can we plan? Our doctor has advised ICSI with donor eggs.',\n",
       "  'output': 'Hello. How are you doing today? There is no limit to the number of times you can do ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection). But if I may advise, why not try to correct the underlying cause for the failure of a healthy embryo growth? An AMH of 4 or more means she has plenty of eggs. But diabetes is mostly spoiling her chances. Hopefully, her HbA1c is normal and other complications have been ruled out. Also, semen factor should be alright. Any problem in either of these should be the reason for poor embryo quality. If you feel all these are fine, then maybe have the procedure at a different IVF clinic, with a different embryologist. I know it is a tough call, but do think about it. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queries. All the best.

       "  'model_output': \"Dear Patient, Thank you for your question. IVF is an assisted reproductive technique in which a woman's eggs are fertilized in the laboratory and then transferred back to the uterus. It is usually performed after a number of unsuccessful attempts to conceive naturally. The number of IVF cycles that a person can undergo is not strictly defined, but it is generally recommended that no more than 3-4 cycles should be attempted, as the success rate decreases with each cycle. In your case, it seems that your wife has undergone three unsuccessful cycles of ICSI with donor eggs. It is important to consider the reasons for the failure of these cycles, as well as the potential risks and benefits of continuing with IVF. One possible reason for the failure of these cycles could be the quality of the donor eggs, as well as the lack of synchronization between the donor eggs and the recipient's uterus. Additionally, the use of donor eggs may increase the risk of genetic abnormalities in the resulting embryos. It is important to discuss these concerns with your doctor and consider alternative treatment options, such as natural fertility treatments or other assisted reproductive techniques. In summary, the number of IVF cycles that a person can undergo is not strictly defined, but it is generally recommended that no more than 3-4 cycles should be attempted. In your case, it seems that your wife has undergone three unsuccessful cycles of ICSI with donor eggs, and it is important to consider the reasons for the failure of these cycles, as well as the potential risks and benefits of continuing with IVF.\"},\n",

The symptoms went away six months back but returned a month back (burning, tingling, etc). I suffer from high blood pressure and anxiety. The neurologists could not find the cause after all tests. I tested negative for HIV but tested positive for herpes 1 and 2. Can herpes cause this? It has been so long since I had these symptoms.',\n",
       "  'output': 'Hello. It is less likely that your symptoms are related to herpes. Herpes infection does not usually lead to such a clinical situation. Besides, a positive test does not always indicate an active infection. The fact that your tests resulted in positive means that you have gone through this infection in the past. In fact, herpes 1 is a very common infection (almost everyone has gone through it). So, I do not think that your symptoms are related to these types of infections. In many cases, no cause of peripheral neuropathy is found (idiopathic peripheral neuropathy). Regarding the pain and burning sensation, I would recommend starting treatment with Pregabalin or Gabapentin. Another possible treatment option would be Duloxetine. I would also advise you to be active. Physical therapy can help improve your clinical situation. You should discuss with your doctor about the above treatment options.

It is important to practice safe sex to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The pimple you are experiencing may be a sign of an STI, but it could also be a result of other factors such as poor hygiene or irritation from clothing. It is recommended that you consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, you can try to reduce the irritation by using a mild soap and water to cleanse the area and avoid wearing tight or restrictive clothing that may cause friction. Additionally, you can apply a topical antibiotic cream to the affected area to help reduce inflammation and prevent infection. However, it is important to note that these measures may not be effective in treating an STI, and it is best to seek medical attention for proper diagnosis and treatment.'},\n",

Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued.However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton.Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed.Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet.When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg.But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice.

If her BP (blood pressure) and blood sugar are normal, then there is no contraindication to normal delivery. Regarding the chances of the head getting stuck, it can be assessed only at the onset of labor by internal physical examination of her pelvis and relative size to head of the baby. A baby of this size may be delivered vaginally, but many parameters should be optimum. She had normal delivery six years back, she is 35 now, her pelvic bones and muscles may have become less stretchable, and she may not get good enough contractions, and the labor may become prolonged in that case the baby in the womb may get less oxygen. These are possibilities that may or may not happen, if she goes into labor, she and the baby has to be carefully monitored, and if the things do not go wrong, then she may deliver normally.

The risk of complications is too high. The baby's weight is not a problem. But if the baby is too big, the mother's pelvis may not be big enough to allow the baby to pass through the birth canal. This can lead to complications such as a broken pelvis or a tear in the uterus. In some cases, the baby may get stuck in the birth canal, leading to serious complications.

       "  'input': 'Hello doctor,I am a 40-year-old female. I went to my doctor a year before because I had a little blood in my urine when I wiped. He did a urine analysis, and some blood work and everything came back fine. There were no problems until three days ago. I peed then a few minutes later it felt like it still had to go so I went back to the toilet but I just got only blood. There was a lot this time, and it was fresh blood and small clots.It is hurting while passing the blood but that is all that came out though I had just emptied my bladder a few minutes before that. The only other symptom I seem to be having is all of a sudden there will be an immediate need to pee out of the blue but then when I go it is not a full bladder of pee just like half but it the onset was very sudden, or I am going to pee my pants.These are my only symptoms. I do have a long history of stones, but I am confident this is not due to that, because I have had blood from stones but not this amount of blood. And every time I have ever had a stone, it hurts worse than childbearing, and I am not in that kind of pain. I feel whatever is going on is the same thing I went to the doctor last year, but he found nothing. What is likely to be wrong with me?I am currently on Coumadin, Lanoxin, Coreg, and Propylthiouracil.

       "  'output': 'Hello. A bladder infection (cystitis), stones and overdose of Coumadin (Warfarin), all three can be the likely reason for your bleeding. In case of any such bleeding, an ultrasound is a must. I prefer to start with a short course of antibiotics (mostly Nitrofurantoin and Cipro or Levofloxacin are given) for five days depending on sensitivity patterns. Blood clotting parameters need to be checked to see if you are on the overdose of Coumadin. Ultrasound is a must to rule out any other serious causes of bleeding like a tumor. Since antibiotics are not available over-the-counter in your place, you need to get back to your general physician. Moreover, even for getting an ultrasound and clotting parameters to check the overdose of Coumadin, you need the help of your general physician. Please do at the earliest.',\n",

There are many causes of blood in the urine (hematuria). It is important to determine the cause of your hematuria as it can be associated with serious medical conditions such as urinary tract infections, kidney stones, kidney tumors, and other conditions. I would recommend that you see your physician as soon as possible. Your physician may want to order additional tests such as a urine culture, a urine test for kidney function, and a urine test for blood. I would also recommend that you avoid over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or aspirin as these can irritate your bladder and cause additional bleeding. I hope this helps. Please follow up with your physician for further evaluation and treatment.'},\n",

How to tell my mom without making her worry.',\n",
       "  'output': 'Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand you are quite worried and frightened about your problems. Social anxiety is common, and it is all about what it does that affects the people more. Your worries about your inability to hold on to a job and avoiding social situations are valid. It is very important to treat social anxiety because if left untreated it will gradually keep increasing and you may end up feeling frustrated and depressed as well. Regarding explaining this to your mother, you can read and find it easy to understand articles regarding social anxiety and ask your mother to go through that. First of all, you need to make her understand that it is an illness like diabetes or hypertension. If it is an illness, it has some symptoms and a proper course and treatment as well. If you had diabetes, would your mother pity you? No, she would ask you to consult a doctor. Similarly, in this case, you will need medicines as well as therapy to overcome your symptoms and gain some control of your life. No one needs to pity you for anything. Once you start viewing this from a rational point of view, you will be able to explain it better to your family. I hope this helps. Take care.',\n",

It is characterized by fear or anxiety in social situations, leading to avoidance or distress. While it may not be an essential disorder to treat, it is important to seek help if it is impacting your quality of life. Therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can be effective in managing social anxiety and improving coping skills. It is essential to have open and honest communication with your mom about your concerns and seek her support in seeking help. Please consult with a mental health professional for further guidance and support.'},\n",

       "  'model_output': 'Dear Patient,Thank you for writing to us. I understand your concern about the dizziness you experience when standing up. While it is reassuring that your echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (ECG) are normal, it is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. One possible cause of dizziness when standing up is orthostatic hypotension, which occurs when blood pressure drops suddenly upon standing. This can be caused by various factors such as dehydration, medications, or underlying medical conditions. To help determine the cause of your dizziness, I recommend discussing your symptoms with your primary care physician or a specialist in cardiovascular diseases. They can perform further tests and assessments to identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms. In the meantime, it is important to stay hydrated by drinking enough water and avoiding alcohol and caffeine, which can worsen dizziness. Additionally, you can try wearing compression stockings or using a compression device to help increase blood flow and prevent dizziness. I hope this information is helpful, and please follow up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and management.'},\n",

In case of former, no need to do anything and get an ultrasound every six months to see if the cyst enlarges. In case of latter, or if size is increasing, two options exist but conservative management with medicines will only provide short term relief. Surgical intervention is the only long term solution.

       "  '__index_level_0__': 26209,\n",
       "  'model_output': 'Dear Patient, Thank you for your question. I understand your concern about having a small renal cyst on your left kidney. While it is true that renal cysts are relatively rare in young individuals, it is important to note that their presence does not necessarily indicate a serious health issue. Renal cysts can be found in individuals of all age groups and are often asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any noticeable symptoms. However, it is still recommended to monitor and manage small renal cysts to ensure that they do not become problematic. One way to monitor small renal cysts is through regular imaging tests such as ultrasound or CT scans. These tests can help determine the size and characteristics of the cyst, as well as any potential complications that may be present. If the cyst is found to be stable or showing no signs of growth or change, then regular monitoring may be sufficient. However, if the cyst is growing or causing symptoms such as pain or difficulty urinating, then further evaluation and treatment may be necessary. Treatment options for small renal cysts can vary depending on the individual case. In some cases, observation and monitoring may be all that is needed if the cyst is small and not causing any symptoms. However, if the cyst is causing symptoms or is growing rapidly, then surgical removal or other interventions may be recommended. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide a comprehensive evaluation and recommend the best course of action based on your specific case. I hope this information is helpful in addressing your concerns. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or if you require additional guidance. Best regards,'},\n",

If all these tests have been done and are negative, and you are not on prolonged use of the steroid, then I will prescribe an enteral antifungal together with the topical cream. Get Fluconazole tablet 200 mg daily for two weeks that will kill the candida from inside. You may also continue your Clotrimazole-Betamethasone cream till the yeast disappears.

Clotrimazole-Betamethasone is a combination medication that contains two active ingredients: clotrimazole and betamethasone. Clotrimazole is an antifungal agent that helps to treat yeast infections, while betamethasone is a corticosteroid that helps to reduce inflammation and itching. This medication is available as a cream or a vaginal suppository, and it is typically used for a short period of time (usually 7 days) to treat yeast infections. It is important to note that this medication should not be used for longer than 7 days, as it can cause side effects such as skin irritation, burning, and itching. Additionally, it should not be used if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, as it may harm your baby. If you have any concerns or questions about this medication, I recommend talking to your healthcare provider. They can provide you with more information and guidance on how to use this medication safely and effectively.'},\n",

This may be due to the hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. The best way to manage fatigue is to control the blood sugar levels. Metformin is one of the drugs that help to control blood sugar levels. However, the dose of Metformin needs to be adjusted based on the blood sugar levels. So, if your father's blood sugar levels are still high, then the dose of Metformin may need to be increased. In addition, your father may also need to take other medications to help control his blood sugar levels. These medications may include insulin, sulfonylureas, or glitazones. Your father may also need to make lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and managing his stress levels. It is important to work closely with your father's healthcare team to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to his individual needs.\"},\n",

It is a process where you have to put a lot of energy, and the muscles of mastication are widely used. It seems there is some neuropathy causing the muscles of mastication to get fatigued. Other symptoms like swelling and numbness can be a feeling due to the same muscles spasms. Local edema (fluid accumulation) can also be a reason behind the swelling. Regarding MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance), I want to add that it can lead to multiple myeloma, so keep an eye on your health. Keep a timely follow-up with your treating physician. I suggest you try using anti-inflammatory medications like Acetaminophen, which can help you. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start using the medicine after there consent. Also, ask your physician to take care of urticaria, as this can be an additive factor. You have chronic urticaria, and that may also contribute to local swelling of tissues. Hope it helps. Please let me know if I can be of further help to you.',\n",

The first thing I would recommend is for your mother to visit her primary care physician for a thorough evaluation. This may include a physical examination, x-rays, and/or other tests to determine the cause of her pain. It is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be causing the pain, such as osteoporosis or a herniated disc. In the meantime, there are some things that you can do to help manage her pain. First, make sure that she is getting enough rest and relaxation. This can help to reduce stress and improve overall health. Second, encourage her to maintain a healthy diet and exercise routine. This can help to strengthen her back muscles and improve her overall health. Third, try to avoid activities that may aggravate her pain, such as lifting heavy objects or engaging in strenuous physical activity. Finally, there are some over-the-counter medications that may help to relieve her pain, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen.
