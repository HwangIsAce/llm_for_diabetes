      "Question: Is qTc interval prolongation independently associated with severe hypoglycemic attacks in type 1 diabetes from the EURODIAB IDDM complications study? Context: Our aim was to assess whether severe hypoglycemic attacks were cross-sectionally associated with abnormalities of the QTc interval in type 1 diabetic patients. The study included 3,248 type 1 diabetic patients from the EURODIAB IDDM Complications Study. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an attack serious enough to require the help of another person. A corrected QTc interval (QTc) >0.44 s was considered abnormally prolonged. Nineteen percent of patients declared one to two attacks, and 13.2% of patients had three or more attacks. Prevalence of QTc prolongation was greater in patients who experienced three or more hypoglycemic attacks. Logistic regression analysis showed that the frequency of severe hypoglycemia was independently associated with QTc prolongation, even after adjustment for diabetes complications, including autonomic neuropathy (odds ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.58).\n",

      "Question: Does hyperinsulinemia acutely increase serum macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 concentration in anorexia nervosa and obesity? Context: Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) plays a role in the regulation of cellular responses to stress signals and inflammation. MIC-1 has also been implicated in mediation of tumour-induced anorexia and weight loss. Increased serum concentrations of MIC-1 were found in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), obesity and type 2 diabetes. To estimate serum MIC-1 concentration in women with AN and obese women, its regulation by hyperinsulinemia and relationship with insulin sensitivity. We examined 20 women with AN, 28 healthy normal-weight female controls and 28 obese women. Serum MIC-1 concentration was measured in the fasting state and after 2-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. At baseline, serum MIC-1 was higher in AN in comparison with other groups (normal-weight, P = 0·018; obese, P = 0·01). Hyperinsulinemia resulted in a significant increase in serum MIC-1 concentration in the entire study population (P < 0·001) and in AN (P < 0·001), normal-weight (P = 0·002) and obese (P < 0·001) groups analysed separately. Postclamp serum MIC-1 was still higher in AN women in comparison with other groups (normal-weight, P = 0·012; obese, P = 0·023). When normal-weight and obese women were analysed together, with the exclusion of AN group, an inverse correlation between insulin sensitivity and the change in serum MIC-1 during the clamp was observed (r = -0·27, P = 0·042).\n",

      "Question: Is the lower pole of the earlobe an alternative site for painless blood sampling in the self-assessment of blood glucose concentrations? Context: Measurement of blood glucose is essential for better control of diabetes mellitus. The pain associated with repeated blood sampling is a significant problem, and a less painful technique would be advantageous. This study was conducted to establish a less painful method of blood sampling for monitoring of blood glucose concentrations. Fourteen healthy doctors and nurses at the age of 22 to 32 years were enrolled into this study. The earlobe was divided into 20 areas. Each area was punctured with a fine needle and the pain was assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS). Then, localized cooling or warming was applied before puncture and the pain was assessed by the VAS. The VAS tended to be lower toward the lower part of the earlobe. The VAS in the uppermost area was 53.1 +/- 19.1 mm and 28.9 +/- 16.8 mm in the lowest part of the earlobe. The VAS was higher in the uppermost area than in the lowest area in six of the seven volunteers (p=0.028). We did not find significant differences in the VAS and blood glucose levels between the control sampling and the warming, or cooling sampling. The localized warming shortens the time to obtain blood by 4.4 seconds (p=0.0426).\n",

      "Question: Does mutation of the Xylanase regulator 1 cause a glucose blind hydrolase expressing phenotype in industrially used Trichoderma strains? Context: Trichoderma reesei is an organism involved in degradation of (hemi)cellulosic biomass. Consequently, the corresponding enzymes are commonly used in different types of industries, and recently gained considerable importance for production of second-generation biofuel. Many industrial T. reesei strains currently in use are derived from strain Rut-C30, in which cellulase and hemicellulase expression is released from carbon catabolite repression. Nevertheless, inducing substances are still necessary for a satisfactory amount of protein formation. Here, we report on a T. reesei strain, which exhibits a very high level of xylanase expression regardless if inducing substances (e.g. D-xylose, xylobiose) are used. We found that a single point mutation in the gene encoding the Xylanase regulator 1 (Xyr1) is responsible for this strong deregulation of endo-xylanase expression and, moreover, a highly elevated basal level of cellulase expression. This point mutation is localized in a domain that is common in binuclear zinc cluster transcription factors. Only the use of sophorose as inducer still leads to a slight induction of cellulase expression. Under all tested conditions, the formation of cbh1 and cbh2 transcript level strictly follows the transcript levels of xyr1. The correlation of xyr1 transcript levels and cbh1/cbh2 transcript levels and also their inducibility via sophorose is not restricted to this strain, but occurs in all ancestor strains up to the wild-type QM6a.\n",

      "Question: Does a missense mutation in the arginine-vasopressin neurophysin-II gene cause autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus in a Chinese family? Context: Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, an autosomal dominant disorder, is mostly caused by mutations in the genes that encode AVP or its intracellular binding protein, neurophysin-II. The mutations lead to aberrant preprohormone processing and progressive destruction of AVP-secreting cells, which gradually manifests a progressive polyuria and polydipsia during early childhood, and a disorder of water homeostasis. We characterized the clinical and biochemical features, and sequenced the AVP neurophysin-II(AVP-NPII) gene of the affected individuals with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus(ADNDI)to determine whether this disease was genetically determined. We obtained the histories of eight affected and four unaffected family individuals. The diagnosis of ADNDI was established using a water deprivation test and exogenous AVP administration. For molecular analysis, genomic DNA was extracted and the AVP-NPII gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The eight affected individuals showed different spectra of age of onsets (7-15 years) and urine volumes (132-253 ml/kg/24 h). All affected individuals responded to vasopressin administration, with a resolution of symptoms and an increase in urine osmolality by more than 50%. The characteristic hyperintense signal in the posterior pituitary on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was absent in six family members and present in one. Sequencing analysis revealed a missense heterozygous mutation 1516G > T (Gly17Val) in exon 2 of the AVP-NPII gene among the ADNDI individuals.\n",

      "Question: Does fermented milk improve glucose metabolism in exercise-induced muscle damage in young healthy men? Context: This study investigated the effect of fermented milk supplementation on glucose metabolism associated with muscle damage after acute exercise in humans. Eighteen healthy young men participated in each of the three trials of the study: rest, exercise with placebo, and exercise with fermented milk. In the exercise trials, subjects carried out resistance exercise consisting of five sets of leg and bench presses at 70-100% 12 repetition maximum. Examination beverage (fermented milk or placebo) was taken before and after exercise in double-blind method. On the following day, we conducted an analysis of respiratory metabolic performance, blood collection, and evaluation of muscle soreness. Muscle soreness was significantly suppressed by the consumption of fermented milk compared with placebo (placebo, 14.2 ± 1.2 score vs. fermented milk, 12.6 ± 1.1 score, p < 0.05). Serum creatine phosphokinase was significantly increased by exercise, but this increase showed a tendency of suppression after the consumption of fermented milk. Exercise significantly decreased the respiratory quotient (rest, 0.88 ± 0.01 vs. placebo, 0.84 ± 0.02, p < 0.05), although this decrease was negated by the consumption of fermented milk (0.88 ± 0.01, p < 0.05). Furthermore, exercise significantly reduced the absorption capacity of serum oxygen radical (rest, 6.9 ± 0.4 μmol TE/g vs. placebo, 6.0 ± 0.3 μmol TE/g, p < 0.05), although this reduction was not observed with the consumption of fermented milk (6.2 ± 0.3 μmol TE/g).\n",

      "Question: Does glipizide treatment of post-transplant diabetes interfere with cyclosporine pharmacokinetics in renal allograft recipients? Context: Glipizide is an oral antidiabetic drug that has been used in the treatment of post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM). However, a published case report has indicated a possible interaction of glipizide with cyclosporine (CsA) pharmacokinetics in two renal transplant (tx) patients. The aim of this open prospective study was to investigate whether glipizide interacts with CsA pharmacokinetics in renal tx patients with PTDM. Eleven renal tx patients (29-74 years of age) with PTDM who received Sandimmun Neoral as part of their immunosuppressive therapy were investigated. No patients had suffered any significant rise in serum creatinine (20%) from any cause over the last 2 wk before the study. Mean S-creatinine was 137 mumol/L (87-220). The mean CsA dose and whole blood concentration remained unchanged during the study. CsA whole blood concentrations were monitored over 12 h in all patients in random order, both on and off glipizide treatment. Blood samples were drawn immediately before the morning dose of CsA was given (trough) and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 h after administration. Whole blood trough CsA concentration was not altered by glipizide treatment, 256 +/- 76 micrograms/L off and 242 +/- 73 micrograms/L (mean +/- SD) with glipizide coadministration. The area under the curve (AUC) and terminal half-life of CsA remained unchanged with glipizide treatment: 6391 +/- 1483 micrograms/L per h and 7.3 +/- 1.5 h without; and 6279 +/- 1601 micrograms/L per h and 7.1 +/- 1.8 h with glipizide, respectively. No change in the CsA peak concentration (Cmax) was observed: 1507 +/- 406 micrograms/L without and 1469 +/- 538 micrograms/L with glipizide coadministration.\n",

      "Question: Does improvement of metabolic control normalize auditory brainstem latencies in subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus? Context: In our previous study (Am J Otolaryngol 14:413-418, 1993), we reported that prolonged auditory brainstem response latencies are associated with microvascular complications and the duration of diabetes in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). To investigate whether short-term improvement in metabolic control also affects ABR-responses, we compared ABR-latencies in subjects with IDDM before and after intensified insulin and diet therapy. Auditory brainstem latencies were measured in 13 subjects with IDDM (mean age: 25 years) before and after intensified insulin and diet therapy. The acoustic stimulus was a half sine wave with a duration of 0.250 millisecond and a frequency of 2,000 Hz. The stimulus was presented monaurally with fixed polarity through shielded headphones TDH-39 at repetition rate of 10 Hz and at 90 dB hearing level. All subjects had normal hearing ability. Glycated hemoglobin A1C (GHbA1C), blood glucose immediately before ABR-measurements, and mean blood glucose during 24 hours before auditory studies were measured before and after intensified therapy. During intensified insulin therapy, GHbA1C improved significantly (P <.05) in study subjects. However, no changes were observed in ABR-latencies. We also studied those 10 patients whose blood glucose improved during intensified insulin therapy. Although blood glucose was significantly lower (P <.01) after intensified insulin therapy compared with that at baseline, no changes were observed between ABR-latencies at baseline and follow-up.\n",

      "Question: Are plasma glucose levels and diabetes independent predictors for mortality and morbidity in patients with SARS? Context: To investigate the relationships between a known history of diabetes and ambient fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels with death and morbidity rates in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In this retrospective analysis, the clinical and biochemical characteristics of 135 patients who had died from SARS, 385 survivors of SARS and 19 patients with non-SARS pneumonia were compared. All patients were treated according to a predefined protocol. Before steroid treatment, the mean FPG level was significantly higher in the SARS group (deceased vs. survivors vs. non-SARS pneumonia group: 9.7 +/- 5.2 vs. 6.5 +/- 3.0 vs. 5.1 +/- 1.0 mmol/l, P < 0.01). In the SARS group, the percentage of patients with a known history of diabetes was significantly higher in the deceased patients than in the survivors (21.5% vs. 3.9%, P < 0.01). Among patients with no known history of diabetes and before commencement of steroid therapy, those who had hypoxaemia (SaO(2) < 93%) had higher FPG levels than those who did not have hypoxia in both the survivor (8.7 +/- 4.9 vs. 6.3 +/- 2.1 mmol/l, P < 0.001) and deceased (9.8 +/- 4.8 vs. 7.2 +/- 1.5 mmol/l, P < 0.001) groups. A known history of diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 3.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4, 6.3; P = 0.005] and FPG > or = 7.0 mmol/l before steroid treatment (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.4, 7.7, P = 0.006) were independent predictors of death. During the course of the illness, FPG levels were negatively associated with SaO(2) (beta =-0.682 +/- 0.305, P = 0.025, general estimation equation model) in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that FPG was independently associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of mortality (HR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.0, 1.1, P = 0.001) and hypoxia (HR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.0, 1.1, P = 0.002) after controlling for age and gender.\n",

Context: The goal of this study was to analyse a possible association of admission blood glucose with hospital mortality of polytraumatised patients and to develop an outcome prediction model for this patient group. The outcome of adult polytraumatised patients admitted to the University Hospital of Berne, Switzerland, between 2002 and 2004 with an ISS > or = 17, and more than one severely injured organ system was retrospectively analysed. The inclusion criteria were met by 555 patients, of which 108 (19.5%) died. Hyperglycaemia proved to be an independent predictor for hospital mortality (P < 0.0001), following multiple regression analysis. After inclusion of admission blood glucose, the calculated mortality prediction model performed better than currently described models (P < 0.0001, AUC 0.924).\n",

      "Question: Is corticotropic axis drive of overnight cortisol secretion suppressed in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus? Context: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a pro-inflammatory stress state, which, with its attendant hyperglycemia, likely disrupts hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) control, further dysregulating glucose homeostasis. To test the hypothesis that endogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-cortisol dose-responsive drive, estimated analytically, is significantly accentuated in adolescents and young adults with T1DM compared with healthy individuals. This was a pilot study of 11 volunteers with T1DM and 10 controls, ages 16-30 yr, at a medical center. Subjects underwent overnight frequent blood sampling (every 10 min for ACTH and cortisol and every 60 min for blood glucose) from 10 pm to 8 am. T1DM volunteers maintained their home insulin regimen. Deconvolution analysis and dose-response estimates were the key outcomes. Mean free cortisol, but not ACTH, concentrations were lower in the T1DM group compared with controls (p = 0.012). Non-invasive ACTH-cortisol dose-response estimates revealed that T1DM patients had reduced ACTH efficacy (maximal cortisol secretion, p = 0.009), reduced ACTH potency as quantified by greater EC50 (ACTH concentration driving half-maximal cortisol secretion, p = 0.04), and increased ACTH sensitivity (more positive ACTH-cortisol slope, p = 0.03). Post-hoc gender comparisons indicated that these differences were limited to females. Linear regression in women showed a strong correlation of both ACTH efficacy and EC50 with C-peptide levels (both p < 0.01).\n",

      "Question: Do macrophages acquire fibroblast characteristics in a rat model of proliferative vitreoretinopathy? Context: Our aim was to establish a rat model of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) induced by macrophages and investigate whether macrophages can be a cell origin of fibroblast-like cells present in PVR. One eye of each rat received an intravitreal injection of macrophages. Clinical examination was performed to evaluate the development of PVR. Histological study was carried out to observe the pathological progression. Immunohistochemical staining with vimentin (VIM), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), α-smooth-muscle actin (α-SM actin), cytokeratin (CK) and CD68 characterized the cell types within the PVR membranes. The distribution, morphological change of prelabeled macrophages, as well as their colocalization with CD68, VIM, GFAP, α-SM actin and CK, were observed on days 3, 14 and 28 after injection. In response to intravitreal injection of macrophages, 90% of the experimental rats developed PVR from postoperative day 7. The histological progression of PVR was characterized by the sequential appearance of inflammatory cell invasion, fibroblast proliferation and scar formation. The dominating cells comprising the proliferative membranes at the advanced stage were fibroblasts. Injected macrophages retained round shape and positive staining with CD68 on day 3. On day 28, they acquired elongated/spindle shape combined with intense staining of VIM but absence of CD68, GFAP, α-SM actin and CK, and became the primary constituent of fibrocellular membranes.\n",

      "Question: Is hyperinsulinemia associated with endometrial hyperplasia and disordered proliferative endometrium : a prospective cross-sectional study? Context: To explore the relationship between metabolic abnormalities and DPE (disordered proliferative endometrium), EH (endometrial hyperplasia) and type I EC (endometrial cancer). We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study that lasted from September 2011 to September 2012 at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University. 314 cases were enrolled, including 56 cases of DPE, 194 cases of EH and 25 cases of type I EC. 39 healthy female cases were collected as a control group. General information was collected, and blood tests, including blood lipids, OGTT (75-g oral glucose tolerance test) and insulin release tests were examined. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0 (Chicago, USA), and 0.05 was chosen as the significance test level. The median (inter-quartile) age of the 314 study subjects was 44 (12) years, with the ages ranging from 21 to 75 years. Elevated insulin level was correlated with DPE, EH without/with atypia and EC. The risk increased when HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance)≥ 2.95 (the lower limit of the top quartile of HOMA-IR distribution in non-diabetic patients); the OR (odds ratio) for DPE was 9.973 (95% CI (coefficient interval): 2.038-48.789, P=0.005), that for EH without atypia was 8.481 (95% CI:1.860-38.672, P=0.006), that for EH with atypia was 18.716 (95% CI: 3.091-113.335, P=0.001) and that for type I EC was 45.199 (95% CI: 5.886-347.065, P<0.001).

      "Question: Is renal hyperfiltration associated with glucose-dependent changes in fractional excretion of sodium in patients with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes? Context: Renal hyperfiltration is a common abnormality associated with diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). In animal models, increased proximal tubular sodium reabsorption results in decreased distal sodium delivery, tubuloglomerular feedback activation, afferent vasodilatation, and hyperfiltration. The role of tubular factors is less well understood in humans. The aim of the current study was therefore to compare the fractional sodium excretion (FENa) in hyperfiltering (T1D-H) versus normofiltering (T1D-N) patients and healthy control (HC) subjects, as well as the role of ambient hyperglycemia on FENa. Blood pressure, renal function (inulin for glomerular filtration rate [GFR], and paraaminohippurate for effective renal plasma flow), FENa, and circulating neurohormones were measured in T1D-H (n = 28, GFR ≥135 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), T1D-N (n = 30), and HC (n = 35) subjects during clamped euglycemia. Studies were repeated in a subset of patients during clamped hyperglycemia. During clamped euglycemia, T1D-H exhibited lower FENa than T1D-N and HC subjects (0.64 ± 0.06% vs. 0.91 ± 0.12% and 0.90 ± 0.10%, P < 0.05). During clamped hyperglycemia, FENa increased (Δ + 0.88 ± 0.22% vs. Δ + 0.02 ± 0.21%; between-group effect, P = 0.01) significantly in T1D-H, whereas FENa did not change in T1D-N. When treated as continuous variables, elevated GFR values were associated with hyperglycemia-induced increases in FENa (R(2) = 0.20, P = 0.007).\n",

      "Question: Is why the radial augmentation index low in patients with diabetes : The J-HOP study? Context: Radial augmentation index (rAI), a marker of aortic wave reflection, is usually lower in patients with diabetes (DM) than in non-DM subjects, even though atherosclerotic change is advanced in DM. We sought to explore why rAI in DM is lower than in non-DM. We performed radial applanation tonometry in 1787 subjects who had at least one cardiovascular risk factor. The rAI was defined as [late systolic shoulder pressure amplitude (PP2)]/[radial pulse pressure (rPP)]. The late systolic shoulder blood pressure (SBP2) and PP2 of a radial pressure wave were used as estimates of the central SBP and PP (cPP), respectively. The age (65.8 ± 9.8 vs. 65.8 ± 12.1 yrs) and mean brachial SBP (141 ± 16 vs. 141 ± 17 mmHg) were similar between the DM and non-DM groups. The rAI was significantly lower in the DM group (83.3 ± 14.1 vs. 87.3 ± 15.7%, p < 0.001), but clinic PP (62 ± 14 vs. 59 ± 14 mmHg, p < 0.001) and cPP (51 ± 15 vs. 49 ± 15 mmHg, p = 0.019) were significantly greater in the DM group than in the non-DM group. In multivariable analyses adjusting for covariates, the significant determinants of rAI were the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (β = 0.17, p < 0.001) in the DM group, and the log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (β = -0.15, p < 0.001) in the non-DM group. The same trends were also seen for central SBP and cPP.\n",

Context: The purpose of this study was to investigate the maternal and children's myo-inositol, glucose, and zinc status in association with spina bifida risk. Sixty-three mothers and 70 children with spina bifida and 102 control mothers and 85 control children were investigated. The maternal and child serum myo-inositol, serum glucose, and red blood cell zinc concentrations were measured when the child was between 1 and 3 years old. These data were compared between cases and control subjects. The association with spina bifida was expressed by the ratio of geometric means and by odds ratios and 95% CI for a cutoff value at the extreme 10th percentile of the control group. The geometric mean of the maternal myo-inositol concentration tended to be 5% (95% CI, -1% to 11%) lower in cases. Interestingly, the odds ratio for the extreme low maternal myo-inositol concentration was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.1-6.0). The glucose and zinc concentrations were significantly higher at 7% (95% CI, 4%-10%) and significantly lower at 5% (95% CI, 0%-9%), in case mothers compared with control mothers. The odds ratios (95% CI) for maternal high glucose and low zinc concentrations were 4.6 (2.0-10.5) and 2.9 (1.2-7.0), respectively. The geometric mean of the myo-inositol concentration tended to be 7% (95% CI, 0%-14%) lower in children with spina bifida; the glucose and zinc concentrations were comparable.\n",

      "Question: Is diabetes associated with impairment of uterine contractility and high Caesarean section rate? Context: The prevalence of births worldwide complicated by diabetes mellitus is increasing. In the UK, for example, <25% of diabetic women have a non-instrumental vaginal delivery. Strikingly, more than half the Caesarean sections (CS) in these patients are non-elective, but the reasons for this are not understood. We have tested the hypothesis that poor myometrial contractility as a consequence of the disease contributes to this high CS rate. We compared spontaneous, high K depolarisation and oxytocin-induced contractions from diabetic and matched control patients having an elective CS. To investigate the mechanism of any differences we measured intracellular Ca, and performed western blotting and compared the tissues histologically. There was significantly decreased contraction amplitude and duration in uteri from diabetic compared with control patients, even when possible confounders such as BMI were analysed. Reduced intracellular calcium signals and expression of calcium entry channels were found in uteruses from diabetic patients, which, along with a reduction in muscle content found on histological examination, could explain the reduced force. Myometrium from diabetic patients was responsive to oxytocin, but still did not reach the levels found in non-diabetic patients.\n",

Context: To determine if a patient-centered, computer-assisted diabetes care intervention increased perceived autonomy support, perceived competence (from self-determination theory), and if these constructs mediated the effect of the intervention on ADA/NCQA recommended diabetes care outcomes. A randomized controlled trial of 866 adult type 2 diabetes patients in heterogeneous primary care settings in Colorado. Perceived autonomy support, perceived competence, patient satisfaction, glycemic control (HbA1c), ratio of total to HDL cholesterol, diabetes distress, and depressive symptoms. The computer-assisted intervention increased patient perception of autonomy support relative to a computer-based control condition ( p =.05). Change in perceived competence partially mediated the effects of increased autonomy support on the change in lipids, diabetes distress, and depressive symptoms.

Context: The chromosome 7q32 region is linked to metabolic syndrome and obesity related traits in the Family Heart Study. As part of a fine mapping study of the region, we evaluated the relationship of polymorphisms to fasting glucose levels and Type 2 diabetes. Thirty-nine HapMap defined tag SNPs in a 1.08 Mb region and a novel deletion polymorphism were genotyped in 2,603 participants of the NHLBI Family Heart Study (FHS). Regression modeling, adjusting for BMI, age, sex, smoking and the TCF7L2 polymorphism, was used to evaluate the association of these polymorphisms with T2D and fasting glucoses levels. The deletion polymorphism confers a protective effect for T2D, with homozygous deletion carriers having a 53% reduced risk compared to non-deleted carriers. Among non-diabetics, the deletion was significantly associated with lower fasting glucose levels in men (p = 0.038) but not women (p = 0.118). In addition, seven SNPs near the deletion were significantly associated (p < 0.01) to diabetes.\n",

Context: This study assessed the efficacy of a closed-loop (CL) system consisting of a predictive rule-based algorithm (pRBA) on achieving nocturnal and postprandial normoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The algorithm is personalized for each patient's data using two different strategies to control nocturnal and postprandial periods. We performed a randomized crossover clinical study in which 10 T1DM patients treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) spent two nonconsecutive nights in the research facility: one with their usual CSII pattern (open-loop [OL]) and one controlled by the pRBA (CL). The CL period lasted from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m., including overnight control, and control of breakfast. Venous samples for blood glucose (BG) measurement were collected every 20 min. Time spent in normoglycemia (BG, 3.9-8.0 mmol/L) during the nocturnal period (12 a.m.-8 a.m.), expressed as median (interquartile range), increased from 66.6% (8.3-75%) with OL to 95.8% (73-100%) using the CL algorithm (P<0.05). Median time in hypoglycemia (BG, <3.9 mmol/L) was reduced from 4.2% (0-21%) in the OL night to 0.0% (0.0-0.0%) in the CL night (P<0.05). Nine hypoglycemic events (<3.9 mmol/L) were recorded with OL compared with one using CL. The postprandial glycemic excursion was not lower when the CL system was used in comparison with conventional preprandial bolus: time in target (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) 58.3% (29.1-87.5%) versus 50.0% (50-100%).\n",

      "Question: Does magnetic resonance imaging reveal altered distribution of hepatic fat in children with type 1 diabetes compared to controls? Context: Children with type 1 diabetes have been identified as a risk group for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim was to compare total hepatic fat fraction and fat distribution across Couinaud segments in children with type 1 diabetes and controls and the relation of hepatic fat to plasma and anthropometric parameters. Hepatic fat fraction and fat distribution across Couinaud segments were measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 22 children with type 1 diabetes and 32 controls. Blood tests and anthropometric data were collected. No children had NAFLD. Children with type 1 diabetes had a slightly lower hepatic fat fraction (median 1.3%) than controls (median 1.8%), and their fat had a different segmental distribution. The fat fraction of segment V was the most representative of the liver as a whole. An incidental finding was that diabetes patients treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI) had a fat distribution more similar to controls than patients with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).\n",

      "Question: Is development of diabetes retarded by ACE inhibition in hypertensive patients -- a subanalysis of the Captopril Prevention Project ( CAPPP )? Context: The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) was designed as a prospective intervention trial comparing the effect of a treatment based on the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril with that of a conventional diuretic and/or beta-blocker-based therapy, in 10,985 hypertensive patients. There was no difference in the primary cardiovascular morbidity and mortality endpoint. A lower incidence of diabetes mellitus during captopril treatment was observed in the whole CAPPP cohort that was non-diabetic at baseline (n = 10,413) as well as in such CAPPP patients that were previously untreated (n = 5033). A multivariate analysis of variables associated with the risk of developing diabetes in CAPPP demonstrated that glucose, body mass index (BMI), haemoglobin (Hb), age, 'SBP x Untreated' (the interaction between systolic blood pressure at baseline and newly diagnosed hypertension), cholesterol and prior antihypertensive treatment came out as risk factors. Based on these factors, a risk score for development of diabetes was calculated for all non-diabetic patients, who were divided into tertiles. For each tertile of risk, captopril therapy was associated with a reduced risk of diabetes development compared with conventional diuretic and/or beta-blocker therapy. When the non-diabetic cohort was divided into two subcohorts; previously treated and previously untreated patients, it turned out that the risk factors for developing diabetes differed between these two subcohorts. Only glucose, BMI and Hb came out as risk factors in all analysed cohorts.\n",

Context: This study was to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of 78 kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) in cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a rat model of liver cirrhosis. A rat model of liver cirrhosis was established with multiple pathogenic factors. A total of 42 male SD rats were randomly divided into the liver cirrhosis group and control group. Cardiac structure analysis was performed to assess alterations in cardiac structure. Cardiomyocytes apoptosis was detected by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling method. Expression of GRP78, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), caspase-12, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells p65 subunit (NF-κB p65) and B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) was detected by immunohistochemical staining. The ratios of left ventricular wall thickness to heart weight and heart weight to body weight were significantly increased with the progression of liver cirrhosis (P < 0.05). Apoptosis index of cardiomyocytes was significantly increased with the progression of liver cirrhosis (P < 0.05). The expression levels of GRP78, CHOP and caspase-12 were significantly increased in the progression of liver cirrhosis (P < 0.05). The expression levels of NF-κB p65 and Bcl-2 were highest in the 4-wk liver cirrhosis, and they were decreased in the 6-wk and 8-wk in the progression of liver cirrhosis. GRP78 expression levels were positively correlated with apoptosis index, CHOP and caspase-12 expression levels (P < 0.05). CHOP expression levels were negatively correlated with NF-κB p65 and Bcl-2 expression levels (P < 0.05).\n",

Context: Repetitive subcutaneous or intracerebroventricular administration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) ameliorates glucose metabolism and enhances energy expenditure in obese diabetic C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. To explore the mechanism of action through which BDNF regulates glucose metabolism, we examined the effects of BDNF on glucose utilization and norepinephrine (NE) content in peripheral tissues of diabetic mice. [(14)C]2-deoxyglucose ([(14)C]2-DG) uptake into peripheral tissues was analysed after intravenous injection of [(14)C]2-DG in db/db and normal C57BL/6 mice, and [(14)C]2-DG uptake and NE content in peripheral tissues were analysed after subcutaneous administration of BDNF (20 mg/kg) to male db/db and normal mice for 8 days. [(14)C]2-DG uptake in the diaphragm, heart, gastrocnemius, soleus and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) of db/db mice was significantly lower than in normal mice. Repetitive administration of BDNF to db/db mice for 8 days enhanced [(14)C]2-DG uptake in the diaphragm, heart, soleus, BAT and liver. The NE content in heart, skeletal muscle, interscapular BAT and liver of db/db mice given BDNF was high compared with db/db mice given vehicle, whereas no significant change in NE content in peripheral tissues was observed in normal mice given BDNF and those given vehicle. BDNF did not affect [(14)C]2-DG uptake or NE content in the white adipose tissue of db/db mice.\n",

Context: This retrospective cohort study examined whether diabetic patients have a higher risk for recurrent appendicitis during a 1-year follow-up period after successful antibiotic treatment for patients with acute uncomplicated appendicitis than nondiabetic patients using a population-based database. We included 541 appendicitis patients who received antibiotic treatment for acute appendicitis. We individually tracked each patient for a 1-year period to identify those who subsequently underwent an appendectomy during the follow-up period. Cox proportional hazard regressions suggested that the adjusted hazard ratio of an appendectomy during the 1-year follow-up period was 1.75 for appendicitis patients with diabetes than appendicitis patients without diabetes. We found that among females, the adjusted hazard ratio of an appendectomy was 2.18 for acute appendicitis patients with diabetes than their counterparts without diabetes.

Context: Psychosis is associated with excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To determine the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with psychotic disorders compared with the population. 731 consecutive patients with psychosis recruited from psychiatric outpatient clinics in Stockholm County, Sweden, were compared with 5580 individuals from a population study performed in the same area. The main outcome measures were waist circumference, body mass index (BMI) and fasting glucose. Mean waist circumference in patients vs. controls was for males 106 and 94 cm, respectively, and for females 97 and 85 cm, respectively (P < 0.001); mean fasting glucose in patients vs. controls was for males 5.8 and 5.2 mmol/l, respectively, and for females 5.6 and 4.8 mmol/l, respectively (P < 0.001). Comparisons were controlled for differences in age and family history of diabetes. Increased waist circumference was more common in psychotic patients compared with controls (OR = 3.99; 95% CI 3.09-5.15), controlling for fasting insulin, differences in gender, blood pressure, fasting glucose, family history of diabetes, age and tobacco use. Increased fasting blood glucose was also more common in psychotic patients (OR = 2.41; 95% CI 1.84-3.14) controlling for the same factors with the exception of fasting glucose and with the addition of increased waist circumference.\n",

      "Question: Do dietary gangliosides enhance in vitro glucose uptake in weanling rats? Context: The intestine adapts to environmental stimuli, such as modifications in dietary lipids. Dietary lipids modify brush border membrane (BBM) permeability and nutrient transporter activities. Gangliosides (GANG) are glycolipids present in human milk, but they are present only in low amounts in infant formula. Exogenous GANG are incorporated into cell membranes and increase their permeability. This study was undertaken to determine if feeding a 0.2% GANG-enriched diet for 2 weeks alters in vitro intestinal sugar absorption in weanling rats compared with an isocaloric control diet or diet enriched with polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids. In vitro uptake of 34-96 mm glucose and fructose and morphological measurements were assessed on intestinal tissue of weanling rats. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, Northern blotting, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were performed to determine the mRNA and protein abundance of the sugar transporters SGLT-1, GLUT2 and GLUT5. Feeding GANG did not alter the rates of animal weight gain or intestinal morphology. GANG did not affect fructose uptake. Depending on the concentration of glucose, GANG increased jejunal uptake of higher concentrations of glucose by approximately 20%-60%. There were no changes in GLUT5 or GLUT2 protein or mRNA abundance. Similarly, there were no changes in SGLT-1 mRNA and protein abundance, as determined by Northern and Western blotting. However, using immunohistochemistry, SGLT-1 was lower in GANG than in controls.\n",

Context: This study was conducted to determine if type 1 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of fracture across the life span. This population-based cohort study used data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) in the U.K. (data from 1994 to 2012), in which 30,394 participants aged 0-89 years with type 1 diabetes were compared with 303,872 randomly selected age-, sex-, and practice-matched participants without diabetes. Cox regression analysis was used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for incident fracture in participants with type 1 diabetes. A total of 334,266 participants, median age 34 years, were monitored for 1.9 million person-years. HR were lowest in males and females age <20 years, with HR 1.14 (95% CI 1.01-1.29) and 1.35 (95% CI 1.12-1.63), respectively. Risk was highest in men 60-69 years (HR 2.18 [95% CI 1.79-2.65]), and in women 40-49 years (HR 2.03 [95% CI 1.73-2.39]). Lower extremity fractures comprised a higher proportion of incident fractures in participants with versus those without type 1 diabetes (31.1% vs. 25.1% in males, 39.3% vs. 32% in females; P < 0.001). Secondary analyses for incident hip fractures identified the highest HR of 5.64 (95% CI 3.55-8.97) in men 60-69 years and the highest HR of 5.63 (95% CI 2.25-14.11) in women 30-39 years.\n",

Context: This study aims to determine whether six polymorphisms of the genes involved in drug metabolism are associated with susceptibility to the development and progression of aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN). In the study, 91 aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) cases and 152 healthy controls of Chinese Han population were examined. Six common polymorphisms of genes, including multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1 and M1, were determined. Associations between their genotypes with AAN risk were calculated using an unconditional logistic regression model. Among the six candidate polymorphisms, only the distribution frequency of GSTT1 null genotype was significantly higher among AAN cases compared with controls (P = 0.041, 62.6% vs. 48.7%) and was associated with a 1.7-fold increased risk (OR = 1.728, 95%CI: 1.013-2.948, P = 0.045) of developing AAN, after adjustment for age and gender. The stratified analysis further showed that the GSTT1 null genotype was dominant in slow progressive AAN patients (OR = 2.497, 95%CI: 1.028-6.064, P = 0.043). The GSTM1 genotypes were not shown to influence the development of AAN.\n",

      "Question: Does high glucose promote intracellular lipid accumulation in vascular smooth muscle cells by impairing cholesterol influx and efflux balance? Context: High glucose promotes macrophage-derived foam cell formation involved in increased influx or reduced efflux of lipids. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of hyperglycaemia on foam cell transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and possible mechanisms contributing to these effects. The results showed that high glucose increased the expression of CD36, a regulator of lipid influx, and suppressed the expression and activity of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCG1, a regulator of cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apoAI was not impaired. VSMCs exposed to high glucose readily developed into lipid-loaded cells, as demonstrated by Oil Red O staining and cholesterol content analysis. In addition, high glucose-induced down-regulation of ABCG1 was reversed by nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitors BAY 11-7085 and tosyl-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). This reversal was accompanied by reduced cellular lipid content. Also, NAC and NF-kappaB inhibitors can effectively block the high glucose-induced activity of NF-kappaB binding to DNA and/or peroxide production.\n",

Context: To evaluate the impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on quality of life in obese diabetic patients compared to standard medical therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus. We prospectively studied two matched obese populations with type 2 diabetes. Thirty patients underwent laparoscopic RYGB and 31 received standard medical therapy combined with a diabetes support and education program (DSE), consisting of educational sessions on diet and exercise. Groups were matched by age, gender, weight, glucostatic parameters, and use of glucose-lowering medications (oral agents and insulin therapy). Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed using the normalized SF-36 questionnaire, and data were collected at baseline and at 12-month follow-up. Diabetic patients who underwent RYGB experienced a statistically significant increase in their overall HRQOL. However, the role-physical and mental health domains increased but did not reach statistical significance. Diabetic patients in the medical therapy and DSE group did not show any significant increase in HRQOL. The between-group differences for the HRQOL changes from baseline were significant, other than for role-physical and mental health domains. Percentage changes in glucostatic parameters, discontinuation of glucose-lowering medications, and T2DM remission were not found to predict the percentage change in SF-36 scores at 12 months after RYGB.\n",

      "Question: Does a2A adenosine receptor agonist and PDE4 inhibition delays inflammation but fail to reduce injury in experimental obstructive nephropathy? Context: Renal interstitial inflammation is a consequence of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Following ischemia/reperfusion, adenosine reduces renal inflammation and injury, effects which are potentiated by type 4 phosphodiesterase inhibitors. We therefore studied the effects of A2A adenosine receptor agonist (ATL146e), and PDE4 inhibitor (rolipram) in mice subjected to UUO. Mice were subjected to UUO or sham operation, and received either vehicle or ATL146e + rolipram by osmotic minipump for 1 or 7 days. At 1, 3, 7, or 14 days after operation, renal macrophage infiltration, apoptosis, proliferation, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis were quantitated, and expressions of IL-6 and TGF-beta mRNA were determined. ATL146e + rolipram reduced macrophage infiltration by 40% after 3 days UUO (p < 0.05). Tubular apoptosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis were increased by 7 or 14 days UUO, but were unaffected by ATL146e + rolipram. However, cellular proliferation was increased by ATL146e + rolipram in the obstructed kidney. ATL146e + rolipram had no effect on the renal expression of IL-6 and TGF-beta mRNA.\n",

      "Question: Is critical illness polyneuropathy in ICU patients related to reduced motor nerve excitability caused by reduced sodium permeability? Context: Reduced motor and sensory nerve amplitudes in critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) are characteristic features described in electrophysiological studies and due to dysfunction of voltage-gated sodium channels. Yet, faulty membrane depolarization as reported in various tissues of critically ill patients may cause reduced membrane excitability as well. The aim of this study was to compare the pathophysiological differences in motor nerve membrane polarization and voltage-gated sodium channel function between CIP patients and critically ill patients not developing CIP during their ICU stay (ICU controls). ICU patients underwent electrophysiological nerve conduction studies and were categorized as either ICU controls or CIP patients. Subsequently, excitability parameters were recorded as current-threshold relationship, stimulus-response behavior, threshold electrotonus, and recovery of excitability from the abductor pollicis brevis following median nerve stimulation. Twenty-six critically ill patients were enrolled and categorized as 12 ICU controls and 14 CIP patients. When compared to 31 healthy subjects, the ICU controls exhibited signs of membrane depolarization as shown by reduced superexcitability (p = 0.003), depolarized threshold electrotonus (p = 0.007), increased current-threshold relationship (p = 0.03), and slightly prolonged strength-duration time constant. In contrast, the CIP patients displayed a significantly reduced strength-duration time constant (p < 0.0001), which indicates an increased inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels.\n",

      "Question: Does metformin inhibit P-glycoprotein expression via the NF-κB pathway and CRE transcriptional activity through AMPK activation? Context: The expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene, is associated with the emergence of the MDR phenotype in cancer cells. We investigated whether metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) down-regulates MDR1 expression in MCF-7/adriamycin (MCF-7/adr) cells. MCF-7 and MCF-7/adr cells were incubated with metformin and changes in P-gp expression were determined at the mRNA, protein and functional level. Transient transfection assays were performed to assess its gene promoter activities, and immunoblot analysis to study its molecular mechanisms of action. Metformin significantly inhibited MDR1 expression by blocking MDR1 gene transcription. Metformin also significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent P-gp substrate rhodamine-123. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity and the level of IκB degradation were reduced by metformin treatment. Moreover, transduction of MCF-7/adr cells with the p65 subunit of NF-κB induced MDR1 promoter activity and expression, and this effect was attenuated by metformin. The suppression of MDR1 promoter activity and protein expression was mediated through metformin-induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Small interfering RNA methods confirmed that reduction of AMPK levels attenuates the inhibition of MDR1 activation associated with metformin exposure. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of metformin on MDR1 expression and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation were reversed by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of AMPK.\n",

      "Question: Are alterations in glucose homeostasis in the pediatric intensive care unit : Hyperglycemia and glucose variability associated with increased mortality and morbidity? Context: Critically ill patients with alterations in glucose equilibrium may experience adverse outcomes. We sought to describe the distribution of blood glucose values in the absence of insulin therapy and to evaluate the association of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and glucose variability with mortality and morbidity of critically ill children. Retrospective cohort analysis. University-affiliated children's hospital pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). All children admitted to the PICU for >24 hrs with at least one blood glucose level recorded from a 1-yr period. Patients were excluded if >18 yrs of age, if insulin was administered during their PICU stay, and if the PICU admitting diagnosis included diabetes mellitus or hypoglycemia. None. Patients were categorized with isolated hyperglycemia (blood glucose >or=150 mg/dL, [>or=8.3 mmol/L]), isolated hypoglycemia (blood glucose <or=60 mg/dL, [<or=3.3 mmol/L]), and glucose variability (both hyper- and hypoglycemia), and the associations with mortality, hospital length of stay, and nosocomial infections were assessed. Fisher's exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and logistic and linear regression were used to test for associations. Hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic measurements occurred in 56.1% and 9.7% of all patients, respectively. Glucose variability occurred in 6.8% of all patients. Glucose variability (odds ratio 63.6; 95% confidence interval, 7.8-512) and hyperglycemia (odds ratio 11.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-85.6) in the univariate analysis were associated with increased mortality. There were no deaths among patients with isolated hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia and glucose variability were also associated with nosocomial infections (p =.01) and increased hospital length of stay (p <.001). Hypoglycemia and glucose variability occurred more commonly in younger patients (p <.001).\n",

      "Question: Does high glucose induce human endothelial dysfunction through an Axl-dependent mechanism? Context: The receptor tyrosine kinase Axl and its ligand growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) are involved in the diabetic vascular disease. The aim of this study was to explore the role of Gas6/Axl system in high glucose (HG)-induced endothelial dysfunction. We investigated the effect of various glucose concentrations on Axl signaling in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1 s). Human plasma Gas6 value inversely correlated with glucose status, endothelial markers. HG decreased Gas6/Axl expression and increased intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in HMEC-1 s. HG significantly decreased HMEC-1 s cell viability and tube formation and promoted monocyte-EC adhesion. Down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation was found in HG culture. Axl transfection significantly reversed HG-induced Akt phosphorylation, VCAM-1 expression and endothelial dysfunction. We also found additive changes in Axl-shRNA-infected HMEC-1 cells in HG culture. Furthermore, Axl overexpression in HMEC-1 s significantly reversed HG-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) expression. In addition, significantly lower Axl and VEGFR2 expression in arteries were found in diabetic patients as compared with non-diabetic patients.\n",

      "Question: Is hormone replacement therapy associated with increased C-reactive protein in women with Type 2 diabetes in the Diabetes Heart Study? Context: Increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers, especially C-reactive protein (CRP), are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and sudden cardiac death. Medical interventions that increase CRP levels, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in post-menopausal women, are under increasing scrutiny. The effect of HRT on CRP levels in women with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is not well documented, and conflicting conclusions have been reported. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of HRT on women with diabetes in a large cross-sectional study. Three hundred and twenty-seven post-menopausal women with T2DM from the Diabetes Heart Study participated. Current use of HRT was determined and serum CRP levels were measured using a high-sensitivity ELISA kit. Generalized estimating equation methods were used to assess the relationship of multiple clinical and lifestyle (e.g. smoking) measures on CRP levels including differences between women taking HRT (HRT+) and not taking HRT (HRT-). Overall serum CRP levels were strongly associated with body mass index (P < 0.0001) and age (P < 0.0001). Of the women, 243 were not using HRT and 84 were using HRT. HRT+ and HRT- women did not differ significantly in measures of clinical traits, with the exception of higher mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in HRT- women (P = 0.004). In all models tested, HRT+ women had significantly higher circulating CRP levels, with P-values ranging from 0.0045 to 0.010.\n",

      "Question: Is a specific expression profile of heat-shock proteins and glucose-regulated proteins associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in oesophageal adenocarcinomas? Context: Oesophageal adenocarcinomas often show resistances to chemotherapy (CTX), therefore, it would be of high interest to better understand the mechanisms of resistance. We examined the expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs) in pretherapeutic biopsies of oesophageal adenocarcinomas to assess their potential role in CTX response. Ninety biopsies of locally advanced adenocarcinomas before platin/5-fluorouracil (FU)-based CTX were investigated by reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative RT-PCR. CTX response strongly correlated with survival (P=0.001). Two groups of tumours with specific protein expression patterns were identified by RPPA: Group A was characterised by low expression of HSP90, HSP27 and p-HSP27((Ser15, Ser78, Ser82)) and high expression of GRP78, GRP94, HSP70 and HSP60; Group B exhibited the inverse pattern. Tumours of Group A were more likely to respond to CTX, resulting in histopathological tumour regression (P=0.041) and post-therapeutic down-categorisation from cT3 to ypT0-T2 (P=0.040). High HSP60 protein (IHC) and mRNA expression were also associated with tumour down-categorisation (P=0.016 and P=0.004).\n",

      "Question: Does vitamin D 20,000 IU per Week for Five Years Prevent Progression From Prediabetes to Diabetes? Context: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with insulin resistance and risk of future diabetes. The objective of the study was to test whether supplementation with vitamin D to subjects with prediabetes will prevent progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This was a randomized controlled trial performed in 2008 through 2015. The study was conducted at the clinical research unit at a teaching hospital. Five hundred eleven subjects (mean age 62 y, 314 males) with prediabetes diagnosed with an oral glucose tolerance test as part of the Tromsø Study 2007–2008 were included. A total of 256 were randomized to vitamin D and 255 to placebo. Twenty-nine subjects in the vitamin D and 24 in the placebo group withdrew because of adverse events. Interventions included vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 20 000 IU/wk vs placebo for 5 years. Annual oral glucose tolerance tests were performed. Progression to T2DM was the main outcome measure. Secondary outcomes were change in glucose levels, insulin resistance, serum lipids, and blood pressure. The mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 60 nmol/L (24 ng/mL). One hundred three in the vitamin D and 112 in the placebo group developed T2DM (hazard risk 0.90; 95% confidence interval 0.69–1.18, Cox regression, P =.45, intention to treat analysis). No consistent significant effects on the other outcomes were seen. Subgroup analyses in subjects with low baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D yielded similar results. No serious side effects related to the intervention were recorded.\n",

      "Question: Does selective blockade of vasopressin V2 receptors reveal significant V2-mediated water reabsorption in Brattleboro rats with diabetes insipidus? Context: In a previous study we observed that acute administration of the selective antagonist of vasopressin (AVP) V2 receptors, SR 121463A (SR), aggravated the symptoms of diabetes insipidus (DI) in homozygous Brattleboro rats (an AVP-deficient strain). The present study investigates in more details the acute and chronic effects of SR in DI rats. In experiment A, different groups of rats received acute i.p. injections of SR (0.001-10 mg/kg) or vehicle alone, and urine was collected for the next 24 h. SR dose-dependently increased urine flow rate and decreased urine osmolality with no significant change in solute excretion, thus confirming a pure 'aquaretic' effect. In experiments B and C, the chronic effects of orally administered SR were evaluated over 8 days in Brattleboro DI rats (experiment B, 1 mg/kg/day) and in adult Sprague-Dawley rats with normal AVP secretion (experiment C, 3 mg/kg/day). In DI rats, the aquaretic effects of SR persisted with the same intensity over the 8 days. In Sprague-Dawley rats, SR induced a sustained, stable aquaretic effect and also increased non-renal water losses, suggesting an effect of AVP on water conservation in extrarenal sites. Because oxytocin (OT) synthesis is elevated in DI rats and OT is known to bind to V2 receptors, we evaluated the antidiuretic effects of OT in DI rats in experiment D. Chronic infusion of OT (3 microg/kg/h, i.p.) induced a marked antidiuresis, and acute SR (1 mg/kg) in OT-treated DI rats completely abolished this antidiuretic effect, thus indicating that it was due to binding of OT to V2 receptors.\n",

      "Question: Does tonsillectomy have beneficial effects on remission and progression of IgA nephropathy independent of steroid therapy? Context: Indication of tonsillectomy in IgA nephropathy is controversial. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of tonsillectomy on remission and progression of IgA nephropathy. We conducted a single-center 7-year historical cohort study in 200 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy. Study outcomes were clinical remission defined as disappearance of urine abnormalities at two consecutive visits, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline defined as 30% GFR decrease from baseline and GFR slope during the follow-up. Seventy of the 200 patients received tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy was associated with increased incidence of clinical remission (P+0.01, log-rank test) and decreased incidence of GFR decline (P=0.01, log-rank test). After adjustment for age and gender, hazard ratios in tonsillectomy were 3.90 (95% confidence interval 2.46-6.18) for clinical remission and 0.14 (0.02-1.03) for GFR decline. After further adjustment for laboratory (baseline mean arterial pressure, GFR, 24-h proteinuria and hematuria score), histological (mesangial score, segmental sclerosis or adhesion, endocapillary proliferation and interstitial fibrosis) or treatment variables (steroid and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors), similar results were obtained in each model. Even after exclusion of 69 steroid-treated patients, results did not change. GFR slopes in tonsillectomy and non-tonsillectomy groups were 0.60±3.65 and -1.64±2.59 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, respectively. In the multiple regression model, tonsillectomy prevented GFR decline during the follow-up period (regression coefficient 2.00, P=0.01).\n",

      "Question: Does inhalation of hydrogen gas attenuate ouabain-induced auditory neuropathy in gerbils? Context: Auditory neuropathy (AN) is a hearing disorder characterized by abnormal auditory nerve function with preservation of normal cochlear hair cells. This study was designed to investigate whether treatment with molecular hydrogen (H(2)), which can remedy damage in various organs via reducing oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, is beneficial to ouabain-induced AN in gerbils. AN model was made by local application of ouabain (1 mmol/L, 20 mL) to the round window membrane in male Mongolian gerbils. H(2) treatment was given twice by exposing the animals to H(2) (1%, 2%, and 4%) for 60 min at 1 h and 6 h after ouabain application. Before and 7 d after ouabain application, the hearing status of the animals was evaluated using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) approach, the hear cell function was evaluated with distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Seven days after ouabain application, the changes in the cochleae, especially the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), were morphologically studied. TUNEL staining and immunofluorescent staining for activated caspase-3 were used to assess the apoptosis of SGNs. Treatment with H(2) (2% and 4%) markedly attenuated the click and tone burst-evoked ABR threshold shift at 4, 8, and 16 kHz in ouabain-exposed animals. Neither local ouabain application, nor H(2) treatment changed the amplitude of DPOAE at 4, 8, and 16 kHz. Morphological study showed that treatment with H(2) (2%) significantly alleviated SGN damage and attenuated the loss of SGN density for each turn of cochlea in ouabain-exposed animals. Furthermore, ouabain caused significantly higher numbers of apoptotic SGNs in the cochlea, which was significantly attenuated by the H(2) treatment. However, ouabain did not change the morphology of cochlear hair cells.\n",

      "Question: Does cathepsin S inhibition lower blood glucose levels in mice? Context: Cathepsin S (CatS) belongs to a family of proteases that have been implicated in several disease processes. We previously identified CatS as a protein that is markedly overexpressed in adipose tissue of obese individuals and downregulated after weight loss and amelioration of glycaemic status induced by gastric bypass surgery. This prompted us to test whether the protease contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes using mouse models with CatS inactivation. CatS knockout mice and wild-type mice treated with orally active small-molecule CatS inhibitors were fed chow or high-fat diets and explored for change in glycaemic status. CatS deletion induced a robust reduction in blood glucose, which was preserved in diet-induced obesity and with ageing and was recapitulated with CatS inhibition in obese mice. In vivo testing of glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and glycaemic response to gluconeogenic substrates revealed that CatS suppression reduced hepatic glucose production despite there being no improvement in insulin sensitivity. This phenotype relied on downregulation of gluconeogenic gene expression in liver and a lower rate of hepatocellular respiration. Mechanistically, we found that the protein'regulated in development and DNA damage response 1' (REDD1), a factor potentially implicated in reduction of respiratory chain activity, was overexpressed in the liver of mice with CatS deficiency.\n",

Context: To determine insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle fatty acid (FA) handling at baseline and after a high-fat mixed meal in impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), IFG/IGT and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) subjects. In this multi-center study, insulin sensitivity and β-cell function were assessed (n=102), using a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic clamp with additional arginine stimulation and a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test.

      "Question: Is impaired glucose transporter activity in pressure-overload hypertrophy an early indicator of progression to failure? Context: Severe hypertrophy and heart failure are important risk factors in cardiac surgery. Early adaptive changes in hypertrophy include increased ventricular mass-to-cavity volume ratio (M/V ratio) and increased dependence on glucose for energy metabolism. However, glucose uptake is decreased in the late stages of hypertrophy when ventricular dilatation and failure are present. We hypothesized that impaired glucose uptake would be evident early in the progression of hypertrophy and associated with the onset of ventricular dilatation. Ten-day-old rabbits underwent banding of the descending aorta. Development of hypertrophy was followed by transthoracic echocardiography to measure left ventricular M/V ratio. Glucose uptake rate, as determined by (31)P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measuring 2-deoxyglucose conversion to 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate, was measured in isolated perfused hearts obtained from banded rabbits when M/V ratio had increased by 15% from baseline (compensated hypertrophy) and by 30% from baseline (early-decompensated hypertrophy). In age-matched control animals, the rate of glucose uptake was 0.61+/-0.08 micromol x g of wet weight(-1) x 30 min(-1) (mean+/-SEM). With a 15% M/V ratio increase, glucose uptake rate remained at control levels (0.6+/-0.05 micromol x g of wet weight(-1) x 30 min(-1)), compared with hearts with 30% increased M/V ratios, where glucose uptake was significantly lower (0.42+/-0.05 micromol x g of wet weight(-1) x 30 min(-1); P</=0.05). Glucose transporter protein expression was the same in all groups.\n",

      "Question: Is serum fibroblast growth factor 21 a superior biomarker to other adipokines in predicting incident diabetes? Context: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) improves glucose and lipid metabolism, but high circulating levels are found in type 2 diabetes, suggesting FGF21 resistance. Serum FGF21 predicts incident diabetes, but its performance compared to established and emerging predictors is not known. We aimed to study the performance of FGF21 in diabetes prediction, relative to other adipokines and established risk factors including 2-h plasma glucose (2hG) during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). We studied 1380 nondiabetic subjects from the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study using the second visit (2000-2004) as baseline when serum levels of FGF21 and other adipokines were measured. Glycaemic status was assessed by OGTT. Incident diabetes was defined as fasting glucose level (FG) ≥ 7 mmol/l or 2hG ≥ 11·1 mmol/l or use of antidiabetic agents, at subsequent visits. A total of 123 participants developed diabetes over 9·0 years (median). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, FGF21 (P = 0·003), adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (P = 0·003) and adiponectin (P = 0·035) were independent predictors of incident diabetes. FGF21 had the best change in log likelihood when added to a diabetes prediction model (DP) based on age, family history, smoking, hypertension, BMI, dyslipidaemia and FG. It also improved the area under ROC curve (AUROC) of diabetes prediction (DP) from 0·797 to 0·819 (P = 0·0072), rendering its performance comparable to the 'DP + 2hG' model (AUROC=0·838, P = 0·19).\n",

The information provided aligns well with the user's concerns about the severity and implications of the condition.\n",

However, it lacks specific questions related to the type of dysfunction, ejection fraction, and the request for the 2D echo report made in the true answer. Therefore, it falls slightly short in completeness.\n",
