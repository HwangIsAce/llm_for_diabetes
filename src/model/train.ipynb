Since glucocorticoids stimulate surfactant synthesis and reduce the incidence of Respiratory Distress Syndrome in premature infants, we also examined the interaction of triiodothyronine and dexamethasone. The rate of choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine was determined in organ cultures of rabbit lung maintained in serum-free Waymouth's medium. In 23-d lung cultured for 72 h, the increase in choline incorporation with triiodothyronine alone, dexamethasone alone, and triiodothyronine plus dexamethasone was 50, 62, and 161%, respectively. Both triiodothyronine and dexamethasone also increased incorporation rates with glucose, glycerol, and acetate as precursors, and stimulation with triiodothyronine plus dexamethasone was at least additive. Dexamethasone, but not triiodothyronine, affected distribution of radioactivity from [3H] acetate among phospholipids. Stimulation was first detected 8-12 h after addition of triiodothyronine, and then increased in a linear fashion. With triiodothyronine plus dexamethasone, stimulation was maximal at 48-72 h, and was supra-additive at all times. Exposure of cultured lung to dexamethasone enhanced the subsequent response to triiodothyronine, but not vice versa. When triiodothyronine was removed from cultures, there was no further stimulation and the triiodothyronine effect was partially reversed within 24 h. Half-maximal stimulation of choline incorporation occurred at a triiodothyronine concentration (0.10 nM) very similar to the dissociation constant for triiodothyronine binding to nuclear receptor (0.11 nM). The relative potencies of thyroid hormone analogs for nuclear binding and stimulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis were also similar: triiodothyroacetic acid greater than triiodothyronine-proprionic acid greater than L-triiodothyronine approximately D-triiodothyronine much greater than thyroxine much greater than 3,5-diethyl-3'-isopropyl-DL-thyronine approximately 3,5-dimethyl-3'-isopropyl-L-thyronine approximately reverse triiodothyronine. The effect of triiodothyronine was blocked by the presence of either actinomycin D or cycloheximide, inhibitors of ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis, respectively. [HYP] We conclude that   O.4   stimulates   phosphatidylcholine synthesis   by a process involving nuclear receptors and de novo ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis.\\nOUTPUT:\", 'output': 'contradiction', '__index_level_0__': 29785}\n",

Considering that cold exposure increases the plasma levels of norepinephrine and lipolytic hormones, but decreases the levels of insulin, we have examined the effects of these agents on glucose transport in isolated rat brown adipocytes using D-[U-14C]glucose as a tracer. It was found that norepinephrine (0.1 microM), glucagon (0.1 nM) and ACTH (100 nM) all increased brown adipocyte respiration (2-10 times) and glucose transport (2-5 times). Studies with adrenergic agonists and antagonists revealed that norepinephrine increases glucose uptake via beta-adrenergic pathways. On the other hand, insulin also increased glucose transport (6 times) but inhibited (40-60 percent) the calorigenic effects of the lipolytic hormones. Both norepinephrine and glucagon potentiated the submaximal insulin responses for glucose transport, demonstrating the existence of metabolic interactions between norepinephrine-, glucagon-, and insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Remarkably, the stimulatory effects of these lipolytic agents were reproduced by dibutyryl cAMP (1 mM), isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 mM) and palmitic acid (0.5 mM), suggesting that cAMP increases glucose transport via activation of lipolysis and thermogenesis. [HYP] Considering that the stimulatory effects of   norepinephrine   (0.1 microM) on respiration and glucose transport were totally blocked by 2-tetradecylglycidic acid (50 microM), a specific promoter of mitochondrial carnitine acyl transferase, it is concluded that   norepinephrine   increases   BAT   glucose transport via fatty acid-activation of mitochondrial thermogenesis.\\nOUTPUT:', 'output': 'contradiction', '__index_level_0__': 29786}\n",

Because increased glucose flux via the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway has been implicated in glucose-induced insulin resistance, we measured the activity of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT; rate-limiting enzyme) and the concentrations of UDP-N-acetyl hexosamines (major products of the pathway) as well as UDP-hexoses and GDP-mannose in hind limb muscles and liver in both transgenic models and controls. GFAT activity was increased 60-70% in muscles of GLUT1 but not in GLUT4 transgenics. GFAT mRNA abundance was unchanged. The concentrations of all nucleotide-linked sugars were increased 2-3-fold in GLUT1 and were unchanged in GLUT4-overexpressing muscles. Similar results were obtained in fed and fasted mice. GFAT and nucleotide sugars were unchanged in liver, where the transgene is not expressed. [HYP] We concluded that 1) glucose transport appears to be rate limiting for synthesis of nucleotide sugars; 2) chronically increased glucose flux increases muscle GFAT activity posttranscriptionally; 3) increased UDP-glucose likely accounts for the marked glycogen accumulation in muscles of   mice  -overexpressing   GLUT1  ; and 4) glucose flux via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is increased in muscles of   mice  -overexpressing but not GLUT4-overexpressing   GLUT1  ; products of the pathway may contribute to insulin resistance in   mice   transgenics.\\nOUTPUT:', 'output': 'contradiction', '__index_level_0__': 29787}\n",

Decide if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.', 'input': '[PRE] We have proposed a model of intestinal glucose absorption in which transport by SGLT1 induces rapid insertion and activation of GLUT2 in the apical membrane by a PKC betaII-dependent mechanism. Since PKC betaII requires Ca(2+) and glucose is depolarizing, we have investigated whether glucose absorption is regulated by the entry of dietary Ca(2+) through Ca(v)1.3 in the apical membrane. When rat jejunum was perfused with 75 mM glucose, Ca(2+)-deplete conditions, or perfusion with the L-type antagonists nifedipine and verapamil strongly diminished the phloretin-sensitive apical GLUT2, but not the phloretin-insensitive SGLT1 component of glucose absorption. Western blotting showed that in each case there was a significant decrease in apical GLUT2 level, but no change in SGLT1 level. Inhibition of apical GLUT2 absorption coincided with inhibition of unidirectional (45)Ca(2+) entry by nifedipine and verapamil. At 10 mM luminal Ca(2+), (45)Ca(2+) absorption in the presence of 75 mM glucose was 2- to 3-fold that in the presence of 75 mM mannitol. The glucose-induced component was SGLT1-dependent and nifedipine-sensitive. RT-PCR revealed the presence of Ca(v)beta(3) in jejunal mucosa; Western blotting and immunocytochemistry localized Ca(v)beta(3) to the apical membrane, together with Ca(v)1.3.

Hyperglycemia with euinsulinemia caused a two- to threefold increase in brain GLUT-3, liver GLUT-1, and myocardial GLUT-1 concentrations only at 1 h. There was no change in GLUT-4 protein amounts at any time during the selective hyperglycemia. In contrast, selective hyperinsulinemia with euglycemia led to an immediate and persistent twofold increase in liver GLUT-1, which lasted from 1 until 24 h with a concomitant decline in myocardial tissue GLUT-4 amounts, reaching statistical significance at 24 h. No other significant change in response to hyperinsulinemia was noted in any of the other isoforms in any of the other tissues. Simultaneous assessment of total fetal glucose utilization rate (GURf) during selective hyperglycemia demonstrated a transient 40% increase at 1 and 2.5 h, corresponding temporally with a transient increase in brain GLUT-3 and liver and myocardial GLUT-1 protein amounts. In contrast, selective hyperinsulinemia led to a sustained increase in GURf, corresponding temporally with the persistent increase in hepatic GLUT-1 concentrations. [HYP] We conclude that excess substrate acutely increases GURf associated with an increase in various tissues of the transporter isoforms GLUT-40 and   GLUT-3   that mediate fetal basal   glucose transport   without an effect on the GLUT-4 isoform that mediates insulin action.\\nOUTPUT:', 'output': 'contradiction', '__index_level_0__': 29789}\n",

olds ( 7 died [ 23.3% ] ; 23 survived ) ( fig . \\n multiple logistic regression analysis showed that icu mortality was significantly positively associated with the following independent predictors : lower gcss , lower platelet counts , and more organ failures before icu discharge ( table 4 ) . \\n this is the first study that focuses on dengue patients in taiwan who require icu admission and is one of few studies that investigates this topic anywhere in the world . \\n first , we found that the mortality of this specific group remains as high as 23.1% , which is higher than reported by other studies . in 1 study of 72 critically ill patients with dengue in northern india , 8 patients died ( mortality : 11.1% ) . in another of 198 icu patients with dengue in new delhi , 12 patients died ( mortality : 6.1% ) . \\n in contrast , another multicenter study of 42 adults with dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome admitted to icu in india reported 8 in - icu deaths ( mortality : 19% ) . a study in brazil of 97 adult patients with dengue admitted to the icu reported in - icu and in - hospital mortality rates of 18.6% and 19.6% , respectively . \\n the differences between our study and others might be the differences in disease severity . in our study , the mean apache ii score was 17.9    9.6 , higher than the 7.5 and the 11 in 2 of the others . \\n in addition , only group c ( severe dengue patients with warning signs and organ failure ) were enrolled in our study , which probably explains why the outcomes of our study were worse . \\n in addition , the mean age of our enrolled patients was about 70 years , older than 2 of the other studies ; age itself might also partially contribute to the higher mortality rate . \\n second , univariate analysis showed that the patients who died had cases of dengue that were more severe , based on apache ii , tiss , and gcs scores , than did survivors . \\n this is similar with other reports that in - hospital mortality was associated with apache ii scores and sequential organ failure assessment scores . \\n in contrast , after multivariate analysis , only the association between lower gcs scores and in - hospital mortality remained significant in the present study . \\n our finding might indicate that gcs scores , in addition to other commonly used severity score systems , are good predictors of the outcomes of patients with severe dengue . \\n third , a multivariate analysis showed that a higher number of organ failures was independently associated with mortality in the present study . \\n like another study which reported that some common etiologies of multiple organ dysfunction  dengue shock syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome  directly related to the organ failure index present a significant risk of mortality , we found that patients who died had more thoracic ( 72.2% vs 20.0% ) , cardiovascular ( 72.7% vs 17.3% ) , and multiorgan ( 93.9% vs 25.5% ) failures than did survivors ( both p  <  0.0001 ) . \\n other studies have reported that patients who die were more likely to have cardiovascular ( 100% vs 12% ) or respiratory ( 88% vs 12% ) failures than were survivors ( both p  <  0.01 ) , that a dengue viral infection with an acute respiratory failure is a significant mortality risk , and that a lower platelet count before being discharged from the icu was associated with higher in - hospital mortality . \\n finally , we found that 80 ( 55.9% ) of our patients developed bacterial infections in the icu . \\n moreover , 15 ( 45.5% ) of the 33 patients who died had pneumonia , and 13 ( 39.4% ) had bacteremia . in another study , 45 ( 46.4% ) \\n patients had had been treated with antibiotics , and 7 ( 36.8% ) of 19 deaths were presumably attributed to bacterial infections associated with dengue . in the present study , the most common pathogen in the 33 cases of confirmed bacteremia was escherichia coli , followed by staphylococcus aureus ( s aureus ) , and streptococcus pp . despite our finding that s aureus was the most \\n commonly reported copathogen , different from that of other reports , the present study and other reports might indicate the clinical significance of bacterial infections in patients with severe dengue . \\n it should at least emphasize the importance of an early diagnosis of cobacterial infections and prompt antibiotic treatment of patients critically ill with dengue . in the present study , \\n crp levels were nonsignificantly higher in patients who died ( 66.9 ) than in survivors ( 43.4 ) , which does not support the hypothesis that crp is an early predictor of dengue severity in adult patients . \\n we enrolled only patients with severe dengue in the present study and found that crp was a limited outcome predictor in patients with severe dengue . \\n we also found that albumin levels were significantly lower ( 2.8    0.6 vs 3.1    0.5 ) and lactate significantly higher ( 6.2    6.7 vs 2.4    1.9 ) in patients who died than in survivors , which was consistent with other studies that low serum albumin levels on icu admission were associated with worse outcomes . \\n although a multivariate analysis eliminated the significance in our study , it still indicates an association between albumin levels and the outcomes in patients with severe dengue . \\n first , because it is a single - center study , the number of cases is limited . \\n second , because of the study design of a retrospective investigation , our data collection might have been inadequate . \\n third , we did not test the serotypes of dengue virus because our laboratory can not do that type of examination . \\n however , several studies have reported the association between dengue virus serotypes and the severity of dengue infection . \\n in addition , the predictors of icu mortality by multiple logistic regression analysis should be considered as the association with mortality but not the biological causes of death . finally , despite several reports showed the association between different medications , such as n - acetyl cysteine , factor vii , diuretic , and fluid administration , and the outcome of dengue patients \\n the mortality of severe dengue patients admitted to the icu remains high , and the mortality was associated with lower gcs scores , lower platelet count before being discharged from the icu discharge , and more organ failures . in addition , a significant portion of patients with severe dengue who die in the icu have bacterial infections .\", 'output': 'abstractoutcomes of adult patients with dengue infections requiring intensive care unit ( icu ) admissions remain unclear . \\n we assessed the clinical manifestations and prognostic factors of patients critically ill with severe dengue.this retrospective study was done in a tertiary referral hospital with 96 adult icu beds . \\n all of the patients with laboratory - confirmed severe dengue infections and admitted to the icu were enrolled between july 31 and november 31 , 2015 , during the large outbreak period . \\n the medical records of all the recruited patients were reviewed for the following information : age , gender , clinical manifestations , disease severity scores , underlying conditions , laboratory examinations , and outcomes . \\n the primary endpoint was to find the predictors of icu mortality.during the study period , 4787 patients with dengue infections required icu admission . \\n one hundred forty - three ( 2.99% ) were critically ill ( mean age : 69.7 years ) . \\n hypertension ( n  =  90 , 62.9% ) and diabetes mellitus ( n  =  70 , 49.0% ) were the 2 most common underlying diseases . \\n eighty critically ill patients ( 55.9% ) had cobacterial infections , and 33 had cobacteremia . \\n the hematologic system failed most often , followed by thoracic and cardiovascular systems . \\n fever was the most common presentation ( n  =  112 ; 78.3% ) , followed by anorexia ( n  =  47 ; 32.9% ) and abdominal pain ( n  =  46 ; 32.2% ) . \\n overall , 33 patients died ( mortality rate : 23.1% ) . \\n multivariate analysis showed that icu mortality was significantly associated with lower glasgow coma scale ( gcs ) scores , lower platelet counts before icu discharge , and more organ failures.the number of severe dengue patients who require icu admission remains high . \\n the mortality rate was associated with lower gcs scores , lower platelet counts , and more organ failures . in addition \\n , more than half of the critically ill dengue patients had comorbid bacterial infections .', '__index_level_0__': 31666}\n",

world studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of initiating long - acting analogue insulins . in clinical studies , both insulin glargine ( gla ; lantus , sanofi us , inc . , \\n bridgewater , nj , usa ) and insulin detemir ( det ; levemir , novo nordisk a / s , bagsvaerd , denmark ) have been shown to result in equivalent improvements in glycaemic control with a low incidence of hypoglycaemia when used as part of a basal - bolus regimen 24 . \\n although glycaemic outcomes in such trials have been similar for these two basal analogue insulins , it has been noted that higher doses and twice - daily dosing are often required with det compared with gla 3,4 . a recent trial has suggested that when both det and gla are used once daily as an adjunct to metformin , a greater proportion of patients treated with gla reached glycated haemoglobin ( hba1c ) levels  < 7.0% than did patients treated with det 5 . \\n attempts to examine the relative advantages of these insulin analogues in a real - world setting have proved difficult to interpret . \\n some studies have reported enhanced glycaemic control with gla compared with det , along with improved adherence and persistence , with no difference with regard to hypoglycaemia , healthcare costs or weight gain 68 ; however , other studies found no difference in glycaemic control between the two insulin types 9,11 , with one suggesting that patients initiating det were 30% less likely to gain 0.9  kg or more in body weight than gla users 10 . \\n studies investigating the efficacy and safety of switching from gla to det are similarly conflicting in their findings . \\n although once - daily dosing of gla and det has been shown to result in equivalent 24-h glycaemic control , switching from gla to det was associated with improved hba1c levels and fewer hypoglycaemic events , compared with remaining on gla in an observational study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( t1 dm ) and t2 dm 7,11,12 . a retrospective analysis , however , reported that switching from gla to det did not improve glycaemic control among a cohort of patients with t2 dm 13 . a recent longitudinal study sought to expand on these data by assessing real - world outcomes using a retrospective analysis of two large , independent , national , us databases comprising commercially insured and medicare populations : the impact and humana cohorts 14 \\n the study found that , at 1-year follow - up , patients who had remained on gla showed significantly higher persistence with and adherence to treatment compared with those who switched to det ( p  <  0.001 ) . \\n in addition , 37% of patients who switched to det restarted gla ( p  <  0.05 ) , compared with only 20% of gla users returning to det after having switched to gla . \\n overall hypoglycaemia rates were significantly higher for patients continuing on gla than for patients switching to det in the humana cohort ( 16 vs. 11% ; p  <  0.05 ) , but overall hypoglycaemia rates were similar in the impact cohort ( 11 vs. 12% ; p  =  0.490 ) . in the present study , to further evaluate the consequences of insulin switching , we used data from patients ' medical records to investigate retrospectively the real - world clinical outcomes for patients with t2 dm who switched between these two basal insulin analogues . \\n the present analysis was a retrospective cohort study using the ge centricity electronic medical records ( emr ) database from 1 july 2005 to 31 december 2012 . in 2007 , \\n the ge centricity emr database contained the medical records of 30  million patients in 49 us states . \\n as the analysis was performed on de -

s subgroup , patients in the gla - c subgroup had better clinical outcomes at 1-year follow - up , including lower hba1c levels and significantly higher hba1c reductions . \\n in addition , significantly more patients in the gla - c subgroup achieved the targeted hba1c levels of  < 7.0% or  < 8.0% and those in the det - s subgroup had significantly higher rapid - acting insulin use . \\n in addition , no significant differences in hypoglycaemia rates and weight / bmi were observed between the two groups . \\n these results could be attributable to lower persistence / adherence as patients might not be taking their full medication . in cohort 2 , however , patients in the gla - s subgroup had lower hba1c levels and a numerically higher ( but non - significant ) hba1c reduction ; similar proportions of patients achieved hba1c levels of < 7.0 or < 8.0% , and similar hypoglycaemia rates were seen in the two groups . \\n although 1-year follow - up body weight and bmi were similar , patients in the det - c subgroup had a decreased bmi and a lower body weight increase , whereas patients in the gla - s subgroup had increased bmi and significantly greater body weight increase . \\n although the patients in the gla - s subgroup gained weight , the increase was  < 1% which , \\n it is suggested , is not clinically relevant 22 , and may reflect differences in follow - up plasma glucose levels or other factors . furthermore , the increase in weight with gla could be taken to be a sign of better compliance . \\n if a switch between insulin analogues is of a  disruptive nature , it will result in decreased compliance . \\n for example , if a regimen becomes more complex ( from once daily to twice daily , adding a rapid - acting insulin etc . ) , it could lead to less of the typical weight gain associated with insulin treatment . in cohort 1 , \\n the patients in the det - s subgroup , who switched from gla to det , had lower persistence than those who remained on gla ( robust in sensitivity analyses ) . this could be attributable to the fact that most patients on det administer twice daily , whereas most patients on gla administer once daily 13,23 . unfortunately , this information is not captured in the ge centricity emr database . by contrast , in cohort 2 , data on patients in the gla - s subgroup switching from det to gla suggested similar overall persistence with treatment . \\n approximately 27% of the patients in the det - s subgroup restarted gla during the follow - up period . of patients in the gla - s subgroup \\n although the reasons for restarting the former insulin are not captured in the ge centricity emr database , these findings are consistent with a previous impact and humana database study 14 . \\n unlike randomized controlled trials , where patients are required to be  persistent with their therapy , real - world patients and physicians do not follow a stringent protocol and , therefore , any differences in patients ' persistence with their insulin treatment can translate into differences in clinical and economic  outcomes 17 . \\n overall , contrasting outcomes were observed when patients were switched from gla to det , when compared with switching from det to gla . \\n this raises questions about the therapeutic interchangeability of these two basal analogue insulins in clinical practice , although further studies are required to confirm this non - interchangeability . \\n the results of the present ge centricity emr switching analysis , however , were highly consistent with the previously performed claims database analysis 14 . \\n the ge centricity emr database is a large and comprehensive source of data to understand clinical practice and outcomes in the real - world setting . \\n this database contains rich clinical information , such as hba1c level , weight and bmi , that is not available in insurance claim databases . \\n overall 25  000 patients were identified in this study , and almost 15  000 were propensity - score - matched and analysed , including those switching from det to gla and those switching from gla to det during the same time period . in previous observational studies on switching from gla to det 11,13,24 , \\n conflicting results were shown with relatively low numbers of patients included ( 301300 patients ) and including either only patients with t1 dm , or a mixed group of patients with t1 dm and t2 dm . \\n our previous study used administrative claims data 14 , and the results described in the present study not only validate our previous findings with a different data source but also strengthen them with additional data on weight . \\n one of the key limitations of the present study , however , is that the emr analysis was carried out on primary care physician prescription data , rather than on claims databases . \\n prescription orders do not necessarily mean that the prescriptions were filled and taken as directed . \\n in addition , certain data were not available , including glucose levels , the duration of treatment with the initial insulin , the duration of t2 dm , and the reason for switching insulin ( e.g. insurance required switching to other insulin ) . although propensity - score matching was used to balance the baseline data between treatment groups , the differences between the groups were quite significant ( table s1 ) and the potential residual confounding might therefore still be present , particularly unobserved selection bias . in a real - world setting , \\n switching patients to another treatment regimen may introduce confounding by indication , an important limitation to observational studies reporting on patients changing their treatment regimens , including the study described here . \\n other potential sources of bias and confounding include the range of time from measurement of hba1c to index date , differences in time for follow - up hba1c and follow - up bmi , and patient / physician preference . \\n in addition , the dose of insulin at the time of switching was not available in the ge centricity emr database and might have impacted on clinical outcomes , especially in patients who had recently switched insulin analogues and had not had the opportunity to titrate their dosage . specifically , the present study was designed to compare between patients who switched to a different basal insulin and those who continued on the previous basal insulin . in the case of comparing patients in the det - s with those in the gla - c subgroup , \\n patients in the latter subgroup may already be fully titrated , while it takes time for patients switching to det to titrate . \\n this may lead to an overestimation of the benefits of gla compared with det , representing a further limitation of this analysis . \\n the same limitation applies to the comparison of the gla - s with the det - c subgroup . \\n one approach to account for confounding by indication is to compare patients in the gla - s subgroup with those in the det - s subgroup directly ; however , these patients had different baseline doses of basal insulin , and based on a real - world study among us patients initiating gla or det , it may be that higher insulin doses were used in the det - treated patients 6 . \\n it is not possible to establish causality from the differences in outcomes , nor are the data necessarily representative of all patients with t2 dm . \\n patients could drop out for various reasons and thus selection may occur . in the present study , \\n more patients treated with det than those treated with gla dropped out from the study population ( 56 vs. 35% ) when 6-month baseline and 12-month follow - up were required . \\n similarly , only 8% of patients on det treatment compared with 40% on gla , dropped out when being aged > 18  years was required ( figure 1 ) . \\n sufficient data on hba1c levels and bmi were missing for half of the patients in this analysis , and this lack of completeness should be considered as a major limitation of emr databases . when interpreting the findings of the present study , it should be remembered that , because of its limitations , the methodology used may have introduced bias or affected the \\n because of the real - world nature of the present study , patients did not have their hba1c levels or bmi evaluated regularly and thus were excluded if they did not have baseline and/or follow - up hba1c / bmi values . \\n overall , recognizing the inherent limitations of real - world data analyses , the findings of the present study alone should not be used to guide clinicians in the decision to switch insulin , but the findings do merit further investigation . \\n future studies should look more closely at a number of other factors , including the dose , duration of treatment , reasons for and cost - effectiveness of switching in patients with t2 dm . \\n in addition , although previous studies have suggested that in patients with t1 dm det was associated with a higher dose and more frequent twice - daily dosing than gla 13,24 , large cohort comparative studies in patients with t1 dm should be conducted to confirm these findings . in conclusion , \\n the results of the present study suggest that switching patients with t2 dm from gla to det might lead to decreases in treatment persistence alongside having a negative effect on glycaemic outcomes . \\n maintaining patients on gla or switching from det to gla , however , might be beneficial , although may result in minor weight gain . \\n this suggests that the two basal insulin analogues might not be therapeutically interchangeable , and further studies are required to investigate this hypothesis . \\n p. l. is a member of the advisory panel for sanofi us , inc . and \\n , has received research support from eli lilly and co. , sanofi us , inc . , novo nordisk , inc . , amylin pharmaceuticals , inc . and boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals , inc . , and serves on speaker 's bureaus for eli lilly and co. , novo nordisk , inc . , amylin pharmaceuticals , inc . and boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals , inc . \\n w. w. , r. m. , f. y. and j. g. are employees of sanofi us , inc . \\n l. x. and o. b. are employees of statinmed , which received funding to carry out this work from sanofi us , inc . \\n p. l. co -

guided prostate biopsies performed for the diagnosis of prostate cancer increases , it is essential for urologists to understand the patient tolerance associated with this procedure . \\n approximately 65% to 90% of patients report pain of moderate to severe intensity , and 20% do not want to repeat the examination . \\n pain during trus - guided prostate biopsy is generated by transducer insertion and needle penetration in the rectal wall , prostate capsule , and periprostatic tissue . by focusing on this mechanism , several techniques and agents for the alleviation of pain associated with prostate biopsy have been reported . among the techniques to relieve pain during trus - guided prostate biopsy \\n , ppnb is the most effective method . in a meta - analysis , compared with no anesthesia , placebo , and intrarectal lidocaine gel injection , ppnb significantly reduced the pain arising from trus - guided prostate biopsy . \\n however , ppnb can have several complications resulting from repeated injections during the biopsy , systemic lidocaine toxicity , urinary incontinence , and degradation of the image resolution as the result of anesthetic injection . \\n in addition , several studies have reported that patients who underwent periprostatic local anesthetic infiltration felt that the pain of probe introduction was as bad as or worse than the needle biopsies themselves . therefore , other methods to relieve pain during trus - guided prostate biopsy should be considered . in the current study , \\n patients in the lithotomy position experienced less pain during trus - guided prostate biopsy than did those in the lld position . regarding the anatomy of the pelvic floor \\n , we hypothesized that the lithotomy position may result in release of the external anal sphincter as the pelvic floor muscles are relaxed . \\n some studies have evaluated the activity of the pelvic floor muscle resting tone in different positions . \\n resende et al .   conducted a study comparing three different positions ( lithotomy , lld , and supine position ) to evaluate the myoelectrical activity of the pelvic floor muscle resting tone . \\n the lld position presented a significantly greater myoelectrical signal of pelvic floor resting tone compared with the lithotomy and supine positions . \\n therefore , we anticipate that pain experienced while undergoing trus - guided prostate biopsy from the insertion of the ultrasound probe may be relieved in the lithotomy position . \\n in addition , we hypothesized that the lithotomy position may be more acceptable than the lld position regarding communication between patients and physicians . \\n some studies have reported that pain perception during prostate biopsy was related to the level of anxiety . \\n bruyere et al .   published a study comparing the pain experienced during prostate biopsy in two different positions : lithotomy and lld . \\n the results of that study suggested that the lld position may be less acceptable and more humiliating than the lithotomy position because of less eye contact and less gentle handling than in the lithotomy position . \\n although the relationship between the level of anxiety and the patient \\'s position during trus - guided prostate biopsy was not analyzed from a psychobehavioral aspect besides the vas score in our study , we anticipate that the lithotomy position may be more acceptable than the lld position because patients in the lithotomy position can see the process of the procedure and the physician \\'s movements . \\n in contrast to our results , kilciler et al .   and lodeta and lodeta   reported that pain perception during trus - guided prostate biopsy is less profound in patients in the lld position than in the lithotomy position . \\n those studies suggested that the lithotomy position may be more unpleasant or embarrassing than the lld position in terms of psychological phenomenon , because the lld position is a more relaxed and physiological position typically used for sleep and rest . by using an adjustable stirrup in the operation room \\n , however , we minimized the physical discomfort induced by the lithotomy position during trus - guided prostate biopsy . also , our study was the first to report that the lithotomy position was a significant independent factor related to pain during trus - guided prostate biopsy , compared with other factors related to pain , such as psa , age , and ipss . \\n our study also demonstrated that pain scores during trus - guided prostate biopsy are lower in dm patients than in patients without diabetes . \\n chronic elevation of blood glucose levels leads to damage to blood vessels and results in diabetic neuropathy . \\n we hypothesize that pain scores during trus - guided prostate biopsy are lower in patients with dm because sensation is significantly decreased in these patients . \\n first , because this study was conducted retrospectively in a single center and included a small number of subjects , we did not investigate other questionnaires regarding anxiety and depression related to prostate biopsy . \\n therefore , additional prospective studies with larger numbers of patients should be conducted to further evaluate this finding . \\n second , we did not evaluate pain scores at each step , such as insertion of ultrasound probe and penetration of the needle . \\n nevertheless , to the best of our knowledge , this series was the first report to investigate the effect of the patient \\'s position on pain during trus - guided prostate biopsy in asian men . \\n in addition , it demonstrated that the patient \\'s positioning during trus - guided prostate biopsy is a significant independent factor related to pain and that patients in the lithotomy position experienced less pain than did patients in the lld position . \\n patients who underwent trus - guided prostate biopsy in the lithotomy position experienced less pain than did those in the lld position , without a significant difference in the prostate cancer detection rate between the two positions . \\n we suggest that the lithotomy position is the proper way to perform trus - guided prostate biopsy to reduce the patient \\'s pain perception , especially in asian men .', 'output': \"purposetransrectal ultrasound ( trus)-guided prostate biopsy is the most useful technique for the diagnosis of prostate cancer ; however , many patients describe the procedure as uncomfortable and painful . \\n we investigated the effect of the patient 's position on pain scales during trus -

documented evidence gathered during the past 35 years has established that induction of thermogenesis in brown adipocytes of mice and rats can reduce obesity ( rothwell and stock , 1979 ) . the maintenance of body temperature by brown adipose tissue ( bat ) thermoregulation utilizes energy stores in proportion to ambient temperature ( kozak , 2010 ) . \\n importantly , bat - based non - shivering thermogenesis may be important in humans as well ( yoneshiro and saito , 2015 ) . \\n therefore , adiposity may be regulated by the capacity of the individual to manipulate brown adipocyte phenotypes at reduced temperature , thereby constituting a strategy to reduce metabolic efficiency ( jaroslawska et  al . , 2015 ) . \\n during the past decade , accumulating data have demonstrated that the gut microbiota impacts body weight and energy homeostasis ( tremaroli and bckhed , 2012 ) . \\n microbial diversity as well as the relative proportions between the members of main phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes have been associated with regulation of obesity in both mice and humans ( ley et  al . , 2005 , \\n the gut microbiota is important for energy harvest on a polysaccharide - rich diet ( bckhed et  al . , 2004 ) and also contributes to diet - induced obesity ( dio ) by modulating different pathways involving triglyceride storage and fatty acid oxidation ( bckhed et  al . , 2007 ) . \\n interestingly , microbiota from lean twins can protect against obesity induced by microbiota from obese twins , when transferred to mice ( ridaura et  al . \\n bile acids ( bas ) produced by hepatocytes , stored in the gall bladder and released into the gut after a meal , are metabolized by the gut microbiota to generate an array of ba species such as secondary bas , e.g. , lithocholic and deoxycholic acid ( sayin et  al . , 2013 ) . \\n these can activate nuclear receptor farnesoid x receptor ( fxr ) and g - coupled receptor tgr5 , located on ibat , to regulate thermogenesis ( prawitt et  al . \\n recent studies have linked changes in the gut microbiota in a cold environment to the thermogenic potential of brite cells through enhanced type 2 cytokine signaling by the innate immune system ( lee et  al . , 2015 , chevalier et  al . , 2015 ) . \\n here we show , in contrast to the role of brite cells in determining resistance to dio in c57bl/6j mice at reduced temperature ( surez - zamorano et  al . , 2015 ) , that acute changes in energy balance in mice fed a high - fat diet at 12c is associated with changes in the gut microbiota , increased ba metabolism , and induction of ibat thermogenesis . \\n we fed mice with high - fat diet ( hfd ) and chow diet ( chd ) at thermoneutrality and at reduced ambient temperatures to assess the effects of reduced temperature on cold - induced energy expenditure and development of dio . at 12c and 17c , \\n the reduced fat mass and adiposity ( figures 1a , 1b , s1a , and s1b ) together with increased food intake in mice fed either hfd or chd resulted in increased energy expenditure ( figures 1c and 1d ) , demonstrating that reduced temperature blocks dio . \\n reduction of ambient temperature from 29c to 17c and 12c induced ibat and inguinal fat ( ing ) uncoupling protein 1 ( ucp1 ) mrna and protein expression in mice fed either chd or hfd ( figures 1e1h and s1c ) . \\n however , ucp1 expression in ing was only 6% of that observed in ibat . in addition , pgc1a ( peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor coactivator 1-alpha ) and adrb1 ( beta3-adrenergic receptor ) expression , which are associated with improved metabolism , was significantly induced in ibat and ing by cold ( figures s1d and s1e ) . reduced cellular energy levels lead to increased phosphorylation of ampk and was associated with increased phosphorylation of acc and increased expression of cpt1a , indicating increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation ( figures 1i1k ) . at 12c mice had decreased expression of biomarkers of hepatic lipogenesis ( figure  s1f ) , a phenotype associated with reduced plasma cholesteryl esters ( ces ) and triacylglycerols ( tags ) in mice fed hfd at 12c compared to 29c ( ces , 12c 6,102.5   446 versus 29c 8,421.1   490.7 , p  < 0.05 ; tags , 12c 155.1   50.4 versus 29c 409.4   43.4 , p  < 0.05 ) . \\n consistent with reduced adiposity , glucose tolerance was improved in mice fed hfd at 12c compared to 17c or 29c and was similar in both hfd- and chd - fed mice at 12c ( figure  1l ) . \\n reduced ambient temperature also improved insulin tolerance of mice on either hfd or chd ( figures s1 g and s1h ) . \\n the improved glucose tolerance was associated with increased glut4 ( glucose transporter type 4 ) mrna and protein levels in ibat and skeletal muscle ( figures s1i  s1k ) . \\n induction of irs1 ( insulin receptor substrate 1 ) mrna at 17c reflected the improved insulin tolerance at reduced ambient temperature ( figure  s1l ) . \\n furthermore , expression of pepck ( phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ) and g6pc ( glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit ) mrna levels was increased in liver of mice housed at 17c and 12c ( figures s1 m and s1n ) , indicating increased hepatic gluconeogenesis , which provides energy for thermogenesis in the cold ( himms - hagen , 1995 ) . to directly investigate the impact of diet and ambient temperature on mouse gut microbiota , the variable region 4 ( v4 ) of bacterial 16s rrna genes was amplified by pcr and sequenced using the illumina miseq platform . \\n we observed 4,090 distinct otus ( from 9,442,775 reads ; ranging from 75,344 to 159,323 reads per sample ) . to investigate how diet and ambient temperature affected the microbiota phylogenetic richness in each caecum sample \\n , we analyzed the -diversity , as assessed by  rarefication and phylogenetic diversity ( figure  2a ) . \\n similar to previous reports , we found that diet is a key factor in shaping phylogenetic diversity ( hildebrandt et  al . , 2009 , turnbaugh et  al . , 2009 ) and observed that the caecal microbiota of mice on chd had higher phylogenetic diversity compared with mice on hfd . \\n we next performed principal coordinate analysis ( pcoa ) of unweighted unifrac distances between the caecum samples from the different groups to determine the effects of diet and ambient temperature on the microbiota . a clear separation between the communities , driven by diet , \\n was observed at the first principal coordinate ( x axis ) , which explained 27% of the variance ( figure  2b ) . \\n the second principal coordinate ( y  axis ) accounted for 13% of the variance and separated the communities by ambient temperature within the diets ( figure  2b ) . \\n moreover , the communities of mice maintained at 12c separated from those at 17c and 29c independently of the diets with the strongest effect in the hfd groups ( figure  2b ) . \\n analysis at the phylum level indicated that the caecal microbiota was dominated by five major phyla : actinobacteria , bacteroidetes , firmicutes , proteobacteria , and verrucomicrobia ( figure  2c ) . \\n mice fed hfd at 12c and 17c were associated with a bloom of proteobacteria and a reduction in bacteroidetes and an increase in firmicutes ( figure  2c ) . \\n shifts in bacteroidaceae , rikenellaceae , and s24 - 7 ( all bacteroidetes ) , particularly in s24 - 7 on chd and bacteroidaceae on hfd , were observed ( figure  2d ) . \\n the increase in firmicutes under all conditions was due to increases in clostridiaceae , lachnospiraceae , and ruminococcaceae ( figure  2d ) . \\n interestingly , a bloom in erysipelotrichaceae was observed in both diets , but only at 29c ( figure  2d ) . \\n the bloom in proteobacteria at reduced temperature was largely accounted for  by desulfovibrionaceae ( figure  2d ) , which has been previously associated with metabolic health ( caesar et  al . , 2015 ) . to identify taxonomic differences in the microbiota composition of mice fed hfd or chd and \\n challenged by differences in the ambient temperature and to identify specific bacterial taxa or species - level phylotypes that contribute to the adiposity phenotype , we applied linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) effect size ( lefse ) with lda score > 2 ( segata et  al . , 2011 ) . \\n this analysis revealed 46 discriminative features in the chd - fed mice ( figure  s2a ) and 34 in the microbiota of hfd - fed mice ( figure  s2b ) . \\n similar otus belonging to class bacilli in particular orders turicibacterales and lactobacillales , the genus allobaculum in the family erysipelotrichaceae , as well as the genus rc4 - 4 in the family peptococcaceae ( figures s2a and s2b ) were increased in mice maintained at 29c independent of diet . \\n the microbiota of mice fed hfd maintained at 12c was enriched in a corriobacteria such as adlercreutzia , number of clostridia from the mogibacteriaceae and ruminococcaceae families , and desulfovibrionales such as desulfovibrio ( figure  s2b ) . \\n similar changes were observed in mice fed chd maintained at 17c ( figure  s2a ) , all of which were lean and glucose tolerant . \\n reduced ambient temperature caused a robust induction of hepatic enzymes engaged in the conversion of cholesterol to primary bas , including cyp7a1 ( cholesterol 7alpha - hydroxylase ) , cyp8b1 ( sterol 12alpha - hydroxylase ) , and cyp27a1 ( sterol 27-hydroxylase ) , as well as in taurine production and taurine conjugation to bas ( figures 2e , s2c , and s2d ) . \\n accordingly , the ba profile was drastically altered and dominated by unconjugated ba ( ca , and - , mca ) at 29c in mice fed a hfd , whereas primary taurine - conjugated bas , i.e. , tca , tmca , and tmca , were elevated in plasma of mice maintained at 12c on both diets ( figures 2f2h ) . \\n fgf21 was 7- and 2.5-fold upregulated in ibat at 12c on a hfd and chd , respectively ( figure  s2e ) . \\n furthermore , type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase expression , which is associated with increased thermogenesis , was induced at reduced temperature ( figure  s2e ) , as previously observed ( de jesus et  al . , 2001 ) . \\n the tgr5 receptor , which binds to microbially produced secondary bas ( kawamata et  al . , 2003 ) , was induced at 12c while thyroid hormone receptor beta was not ( figures s2e  s2 g ) . to investigate whether the gut microbiota and bas were altered in response to reduced temperature or reduction in obesity \\n , we performed a kinetic experiment and analyzed the microbiota in mice that were fed hfd for 4  weeks at 29c and then transferred to 12c for 6  days . increased fat mass and adiposity after 4  weeks of a hfd at 29c was not affected by reduced ambient temperature ( figures 3a and 3b ) , and the increased demand for fuel was satisfied by a 20% increase in food intake within 2  days of cold exposure ( figure  3c ) . \\n cold exposure induced ucp1 expression 5-fold in ibat after 1  day at 12c ( figure  3d ) , similar to the increase observed after 4  weeks at 12c ( compare with figure  1e ) . \\n the induction of ucp1 in ing was very low and therefore not associated with  the initial response required for survival in the cold ( figure  3d ) . \\n the gut microbiota and ba composition were shifted to the cold - adapted state within 1  day , demonstrating that these changes were independent of reduced adiposity ( figures 3e3h ) . \\n the bas profile , already modified 1  day after cold exposure , was dominated by conjugated bas ( tca , tmca , tmca , and tmca ) , whereas the levels of unconjugated bas ( mca , mca , and mca ) were reduced compared to 29c ( figure  3e ) . \\n analysis on caecal microbiota composition showed a significant decrease in the phylogenetic diversity already 2  days after cold exposure compared to 29c ( figure  3f ) . at the phylum level , deferribacteres increased and verrucomicrobia decreased within 1  day of cold ( figure  3 g ) . \\n bacteroidetes increased and firmicutes decreased , but not until after 6  days at 12c ( figure  3 g ) , to increase the bacteroidetes / firmicutes ratio ( figure  3h ) . at the family level , the most abundant phylotypes affected by cold exposure were bacteroidaceae , rikenellaceae , porphyromonadaceae , deferribacteraceae , lactobacillaceae , clostridiaceae , and peptostreptococcaceae ( figure  s3a ) . \\n the fraction of others , such as s24 - 7 , clostridiales , lachnospiraceae , ruminococcaceae , erysipelotrichaceae , and desulfovibrionaceae ( figure  s3a ) did not change when mice were transferred to cold for 6  days , suggesting that these microbial phylotypes are associated with hfd feeding . \\n similar to the initial cold - exposure experiment for 4  weeks , we observed that adlercreutzia and bacteroides were increased after 6  days of cold exposure ( figure  s3b ) . \\n the firmicutes , lactobacillus , clostridiaceae , genus smb53 , dehalobacterium , peptostreptococcaceae , and mogibacteriaceae decreased at 12c ( figure  s3b ) . \\n long - term cold exposure induced a bloom in proteobacteria , particularly in desulfovibrionaceae ( figure  s2b ) , but it did not change during the short - term exposure at 12c ( figure  s3a ) . \\n these data suggest that in parallel with ucp1 induction , changes in microbiota and bas occur when ambient temperature is reduced , but independent of changes in adiposity . to assess the capacity of the gut microbiota from mice maintained at reduced ambient temperature to modulate the development of dio \\n mice colonized with microbiota from donors kept at 12c had reduced fat mass and adiposity as well as significantly higher expression of ucp1 and dio2 mrna and protein in ibat compared with mice colonized with microbiota from 29c ( figures 4a4e ) . \\n expression of adrb3 , pgc1a , and fgf21was not altered in ibat ( figure  4c ) ; no changes in gene expression were detected in ing of recipient mice ( figure  4f ) . \\n the glucose response was improved in the recipient mice colonized with microbiota from donor kept at 12c , but no differences occurred in glut4 protein levels in muscle and ibat ( figures 4 g , s4a , and s4b ) . \\n recipient mice , colonized with microbiota from donors kept at 12c , had increased hepatic expression of cyp8b1 and cyp7b1 ( 25-hydroxycholesterol 7alpha - hydroxylase ) and csd ( cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase ) , leading to an altered ba profile ( figures s4c and 4h ) . \\n these mice had an increased proportion of conjugated , and a reduced proportion of primary unconjugated , bas ( ca , cdca , and mca ) and secondary bas ( dca and udca ) in the plasma ( figure  4h ) . \\n gut microbiota transferred from donors housed at 12c influenced hepatic lipid metabolism , inducing ampk phosphorylation augmenting lipid -oxidation in liver compared with microbiota from 29c ( figures 4i4k and s4d ) . \\n nonetheless , lipid analysis showed a modest increase in total tag in plasma in mice colonized with microbiota from  donor kept at 12c ( figure  s4e ) . \\n these results suggest that functional differences between microbiota of mice kept  at 12c and 29c can be transferred to recipient mice kept at 23c . \\n a primary and essential task of all endothermic animals is to maintain a normal body temperature by inducing thermogenesis in response to cold . here , we demonstrate that reducing ambient temperature from 29c to 12c or even 17c also protects the host from dio , an effect that is associated with increased ucp1 expression in ibat . \\n however , recent studies have shown that the pathway for activating thermogenesis may be more complex than the traditional model based on ibat thermogenesis . \\n thermogenesis occurs not only in ibat , but also by the induction of brite cells in wat at 29c by administration of interleukin 4 ( qiu et  al . , \\n similarly , the thermogenic program in ibat may be activated by bas at 29c ( zietak and kozak , 2016 ) . \\n recently , it was shown that the depletion of the microbiota by antibiotic treatment or gf conditions stimulates the induction of brite cells by enhanced type 2 cytokine signaling from eosinophil infiltration ( surez - zamorano et  al . , 2015 ) . here , we show that both the acute and chronic exposure to reduced ambient temperature leads to induction of ucp1 in ibat and rapid changes in the composition of the gut microbiota and ba metabolism . \\n the results suggest that the induction of cold - mediated thermogenesis involves the activation of ibat thermogenesis by a mechanism involving modulation of ba metabolism and ampk phosphorylation by the gut microbiota . \\n a key question is whether the improved obesity / diabetic phenotype of mice with dio reared in the cold is dependent on the effects of the gut microbiota . \\n we observed that cold exposure is linked to altered caecal microbiota and that mice on both diets shared microbial phylotypes associated with changes in ambient temperature . \\n bacteria belonging to bacilli and erysipelotrichaceae , usually associated with obesity ( turnbaugh et  al . , 2009 ) , were enriched in mice at 29c , whereas adlercreutzia and desulfovibrio , associated with leanness ( caesar et  al . \\n , 2015 , goodrich et  al . , 2014 ) , were increased at 12c . \\n changes in the composition of gut microbiota occurring within 1  day of exposure at 12c and in the absence of changes in adiposity suggest that the changes in microbiota are driven by changes in temperature rather than merely reflecting obesity . \\n the major microbiota changes occurring in parallel with induction of ucp1 were reduced firmicutes apparent after 1  day and an increase in bacteroidetes after 6  days , changes previously linked with protection against obesity ( ley et  al . , 2005 , turnbaugh et  al . , 2008 ) . \\n ( 2015 ) , we identified a decreased abundance of verrucomicrobia and an increased abundance of deferribacteres when mice were exposed to cold , suggesting that altered abundance of members in these phyla contribute to the cold - induced phenotype . \\n changes in other bacteria after longer cold exposure may be in response to altered adiposity of the host . \\n the mechanism by which the gut microbiota influences adiposity may include modulation of ba metabolism ( sayin et  al . , 2013 ) . \\n bas are microbial - derived metabolic regulators , which can suppress dio through increased energy expenditure ( watanabe et  al . , 2012 ) . here \\n we show that lower ambient temperature increased production of bas and expression of genes related to ba synthesis . \\n the increased levels of conjugated bas may be attributed to reduced levels of lactobacillus , which has high deconjugation capacity upon cold exposure . \\n these observations were confirmed in the kinetics study where conjugated bas were increased and lactobacillus was decreased after 1  day at 12c . \\n the increased prevalence of taurine species in the cold might antagonize fxr receptor ( sayin et  al . , 2013 ) and protect against dio as fxr - deficient mice are resistant to dio ( prawitt et  al . \\n , 2011a ) . in agreement with inhibition of fxr signaling in the cold - exposed animals , we observed increased expression of enzymes involved in ba synthesis and increased ba pool size . \\n the cold - exposed mice had a ba profile that resembled that of gf mice , which also are resistant to dio and have increased expression of phosphorylated ampk in the liver ( bckhed et  al . , 2007 ) . \\n ampk activation inhibits fxr activity ( lien et  al . , 2014 ) and also promotes energy expenditure . \\n accordingly , we observed increased expression of phosphorylated acc as well as downstream cpt1a expression , which is associated with increased fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure . \\n importantly , we observed this phenotype both following cold - exposure as well as after microbiota transfer , suggesting that the phenotype is linked to the altered microbiota . in the current study , \\n cold exposure at 12c causes a strong and rapid induction of the brown adipose phenotype in ibat , but not in ing , an increased whole -

pad . on the other hand , among non - dm patients \\n of these patients , mortality rate was significantly higher among pad group ( 39% versus 13% ; p = 0.007 ) in comparison to non - pad . \\n univariate analysis ( figure 1 ) shows the mortality rate in patients with fu in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients . on multivariate analysis , after adjusting for dm , hba1c , age , and gender , the presence of pad was the major independent predictor of development of fu in hd patients with an adjusted odd ratio ( aor ) of 16.0 ( 95% confidence interval ( ci ) : 4.4162.18 , p = 0.001 ) followed by duration of hd with aor 1.14 ( 95% ci : 1.0051.299 , p = 0.042 ) . \\n furthermore , after adjusting for age , sex , and cad , predictors of mortality in hd patients were pad ( aor 4.1 ; 95% ci : 1.948.59 , p = 0.001 ) , fu ( aor 3.6 ; 95% ci : 1.2810.002 , p = 0.01 ) , and dm ( aor 2.7 , 95% ci : 1.235.89 , p = 0.01 ) ( figures 4 and 5 ) . \\n the present study highlights the frequency and implications of fu in patients undergoing maintenance hd over a 5-year duration . \\n the mortality rates were higher in patients with fu in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients ; however it was relatively higher in diabetic patients . \\n moreover , fu was associated with 4-fold increased risk of mortality after adjusting for age , sex , and cad . \\n presence of pad was associated with 16-fold increased risk of fu in hd after adjustment for age , sex , dm , and duration of hd . \\n patients in the fu group underwent higher number of repeated hd vascular accesses in comparison to non - fu group . \\n recent studies have identified an increased risk of fu and lea in ckd patients who did not receive renal replacement therapy [ 10 , 17 ] . \\n other studies investigated patients of combined dm with esrd and found a higher risk of fu in patients undergoing hd [ 11 , 15 ] . \\n a swedish study demonstrated a 2.45 times increased risk of lea in esrd patients compared to those without esrd . \\n similarly , prompers et al .   found the risk of nonhealing of fu to be 2.3-fold higher in esrd than in non - esrd patients . \\n the correlation between dialysis and foot complications among patients with dm and ckd has been initially described by mcgrath and curran . \\n they observed 50% mortality rate at one - year follow - up after lea . in our study , the rate of major amputation was significantly higher in fu patients which corroborates with an earlier study showing increased rate of amputation in ckd patients undergoing dialysis ( 57% ) as compared to those without dialysis ( 25% ) . \\n the relevance of selecting fu in our report is that it is potentially preventable , and its progression generally leads to serious foot complications , major amputation , and mortality . in their long - term follow - up study \\n ( 10 years ) , morbach and coworkers   concluded that patients with diabetic foot had high mortality particularly in the presence of pad or renal failure . in comparison to that study \\n , our 5-year study showed that fu patients had higher mortality ( 81% versus 70.4% ) although our patients were 6 years younger and less likely to have dm ( 83% versus 100% ) and pad ( 34% versus 55.5% ) . \\n moreover , the entire cohort of the present study was undergoing hd ( 100% versus 4% ) . \\n the association of severe complications in hd patients might be attributed to the cardiovascular risk factors . \\n several contributing factors have been proposed for the development of fu in patients with esrd and dm . \\n the important risk factors for the development of diabetic fu involve distal polyneuropathy , microangiopathy , and macroangiopathy . also , cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy is another coexisting complication of dm . \\n the authors found that pad is independently associated with esrd . according to one of our recent studies , \\n pad patients had 4- to 5-fold increased incidence of fu and lea in comparison to non - pad patients . in our study , \\n a higher incidence of retinopathy , polyvascular disease , angina , pad , and nephropathy was associated with fu . \\n studied the risk factors associated with prevalent fu in patients with dm and ckd ( predialysis versus on - dialysis ) . \\n the authors reported that dialysis therapy and previous fu were the only independent predictors of the development of new fu . \\n kaminski et al .   reported a high prevalence of risk factors for fu present in patients with esrd either with or without the coexistence of dm . \\n the authors did not indicate the severity of esrf or whether the patients were on dialysis or not . \\n .   found that dm , preexisting comorbidities , cvd , hd inadequacy , and lower serum albumin level are the major factors for lea . \\n consistent with our findings , a recent meta - analysis reported higher association of cvd , dm , and fu . ischemic in comparison to neuropathic ulcers are associated with higher mortality rate . moreover , \\n the marked inflammatory response during the process of ulceration has a significant role in the initiation and worsening of the atherosclerosis . in our study , among hd patients without diabetes , only 7% developed fu , despite a high prevalence of pad and cad . \\n wolf et al .   reported that the presence of dm in esrf patients increases the risk of lea 10 times in comparison to those who are diabetic without esrf . \\n moreover , during hd , around 4% of patients require an amputation each year [ 17 , 25 ] . \\n our subanalysis showed significantly higher incidence of fu , amputation , and mortality in diabetic patients than in non - dm patients . \\n also , patients with combined dm and pad revealed increased association of fu , amputation , and mortality . \\n our findings are supported by a large meta - analysis which showed that pad is independently associated with cvd and all - cause mortality . \\n further , the authors reported an increased risk of all - cause mortality in diabetic patients who developed fu than in diabetics without fu . \\n it is not possible to specify the extent of infection , neuropathy , ischemia , depth , or extent of tissue loss grade of fu . \\n another limitation is the additive effect of diabetes on hd patients who developed foot ulcers . \\n we did not know how many hd patients developed dm during the follow - up . in order to confirm our findings \\n , large sample - sized studies are needed to establish the implications of fu in hd patients . \\n abi < 9 was used as a part of the diagnosis of pad which may lead to underestimation of the disease . \\n previous data showed that as with low abi , high rates of mortality , vascular events , and amputation were reported in patients with high abi or noncompressible vessels . in a large study of patients with dm and cad , singh et al .   reported a high prevalence of arterial stiffness , similar to that seen in older individuals and dialysis patients . \\n ( 2014 ) defined pad as an abi < 0.9 or > 1.4 , these high abi values were observed in patients with diabetes , particularly for those with concomitant ckd . in conclusion , hemodialysis is a significant risk factor for fu which needs special attention . \\n further , pad is significantly associated with fu , amputation , and mortality in diabetic hd patients . \\n the increased risk of mortality could be explained by the greater burden of cvd in these patients . \\n therefore , hd patient needs intensive foot care to avoid complications of the lower limb and warrant progressive modification of cvd risk factors .\", 'output': 'foot ulceration ( fu ) remains a serious concern for patients worldwide . \\n we analyzed the incidence , risk factors , and outcome of fu in hemodialysis ( hd ) patients . \\n a retrospective cohort study was conducted for 252 hd patients who were followed up for 5 years . \\n patients were categorized according to whether they developed fu or not . \\n the fu group ( 17% ) was older and had significantly higher incidence of nephropathy , retinopathy , peripheral ( pad ) , coronary artery disease ( cad ) , and diabetes mellitus ( dm ) as compared to no - fu group . \\n fu group had higher frequency of major amputation ( p = 0.001 ) and hd vascular access ( p = 0.01 ) . \\n patients with combined dm and pad had a 10-fold increased risk of fu in comparison to those who had dm alone . \\n presence of pad was the main independent predictor for development of fu in hd with an adjusted odd ratio ( aor ) of 16.0 ( 95% ci : 4.4162.18 ; p = 0.001 ) . \\n after adjusting for age , sex , and cad , predictors for mortality were pad ( aor 4.3 ) , fu ( aor 3.6 ) , and dm ( aor 2.6 ) . \\n fu is common in hd patients regardless of dm . \\n however , the presence of pad is significantly associated with more fu and mortality in hd . \\n hd patients need intensive foot care and warrant progressive modification of vascular risk factors .', '__index_level_0__': 31670}\n",
