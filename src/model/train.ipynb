The study included 3,248 type 1 diabetic patients from the EURODIAB IDDM Complications Study. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an attack serious enough to require the help of another person. A corrected QTc interval (QTc) >0.44 s was considered abnormally prolonged. Nineteen percent of patients declared one to two attacks, and 13.2% of patients had three or more attacks. Prevalence of QTc prolongation was greater in patients who experienced three or more hypoglycemic attacks.

Context: Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) plays a role in the regulation of cellular responses to stress signals and inflammation. MIC-1 has also been implicated in mediation of tumour-induced anorexia and weight loss. Increased serum concentrations of MIC-1 were found in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), obesity and type 2 diabetes. To estimate serum MIC-1 concentration in women with AN and obese women, its regulation by hyperinsulinemia and relationship with insulin sensitivity. We examined 20 women with AN, 28 healthy normal-weight female controls and 28 obese women. Serum MIC-1 concentration was measured in the fasting state and after 2-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. At baseline, serum MIC-1 was higher in AN in comparison with other groups (normal-weight, P = 0·018; obese, P = 0·01). Hyperinsulinemia resulted in a significant increase in serum MIC-1 concentration in the entire study population (P < 0·001) and in AN (P < 0·001), normal-weight (P = 0·002) and obese (P < 0·001) groups analysed separately. Postclamp serum MIC-1 was still higher in AN women in comparison with other groups (normal-weight, P = 0·012; obese, P = 0·023). When normal-weight and obese women were analysed together, with the exclusion of AN group, an inverse correlation between insulin sensitivity and the change in serum MIC-1 during the clamp was observed (r = -0·27, P = 0·042).', 'output': 'Hyperinsulinemia resulted in a significant increase in serum MIC-1 in different states of adiposity.

Context: Measurement of blood glucose is essential for better control of diabetes mellitus. The pain associated with repeated blood sampling is a significant problem, and a less painful technique would be advantageous. This study was conducted to establish a less painful method of blood sampling for monitoring of blood glucose concentrations. Fourteen healthy doctors and nurses at the age of 22 to 32 years were enrolled into this study. The earlobe was divided into 20 areas. Each area was punctured with a fine needle and the pain was assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS). Then, localized cooling or warming was applied before puncture and the pain was assessed by the VAS. The VAS tended to be lower toward the lower part of the earlobe. The VAS in the uppermost area was 53.1 +/- 19.1 mm and 28.9 +/- 16.8 mm in the lowest part of the earlobe. The VAS was higher in the uppermost area than in the lowest area in six of the seven volunteers (p=0.028). We did not find significant differences in the VAS and blood glucose levels between the control sampling and the warming, or cooling sampling. The localized warming shortens the time to obtain blood by 4.4 seconds (p=0.0426).', 'output': 'The area of the ear, but not localized cooling or warming, significantly affects the pain in sampling blood from the earlobe.

Context: Trichoderma reesei is an organism involved in degradation of (hemi)cellulosic biomass. Consequently, the corresponding enzymes are commonly used in different types of industries, and recently gained considerable importance for production of second-generation biofuel. Many industrial T. reesei strains currently in use are derived from strain Rut-C30, in which cellulase and hemicellulase expression is released from carbon catabolite repression. Nevertheless, inducing substances are still necessary for a satisfactory amount of protein formation. Here, we report on a T. reesei strain, which exhibits a very high level of xylanase expression regardless if inducing substances (e.g. D-xylose, xylobiose) are used. We found that a single point mutation in the gene encoding the Xylanase regulator 1 (Xyr1) is responsible for this strong deregulation of endo-xylanase expression and, moreover, a highly elevated basal level of cellulase expression. This point mutation is localized in a domain that is common in binuclear zinc cluster transcription factors. Only the use of sophorose as inducer still leads to a slight induction of cellulase expression. Under all tested conditions, the formation of cbh1 and cbh2 transcript level strictly follows the transcript levels of xyr1. The correlation of xyr1 transcript levels and cbh1/cbh2 transcript levels and also their inducibility via sophorose is not restricted to this strain, but occurs in all ancestor strains up to the wild-type QM6a.', 'output': 'Engineering a key transcription factor of a target regulon seems to be a promising strategy in order to increase enzymes yields independent of the used substrate or inducer. The regulatory domain where the described mutation is located is certainly an interesting research target for all organisms that also depend so far on certain inducing conditions.', '__index_level_0__': 26636}\n",

Context: Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, an autosomal dominant disorder, is mostly caused by mutations in the genes that encode AVP or its intracellular binding protein, neurophysin-II. The mutations lead to aberrant preprohormone processing and progressive destruction of AVP-secreting cells, which gradually manifests a progressive polyuria and polydipsia during early childhood, and a disorder of water homeostasis. We characterized the clinical and biochemical features, and sequenced the AVP neurophysin-II(AVP-NPII) gene of the affected individuals with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus(ADNDI)to determine whether this disease was genetically determined. We obtained the histories of eight affected and four unaffected family individuals. The diagnosis of ADNDI was established using a water deprivation test and exogenous AVP administration. For molecular analysis, genomic DNA was extracted and the AVP-NPII gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The eight affected individuals showed different spectra of age of onsets (7-15 years) and urine volumes (132-253 ml/kg/24 h). All affected individuals responded to vasopressin administration, with a resolution of symptoms and an increase in urine osmolality by more than 50%. The characteristic hyperintense signal in the posterior pituitary on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was absent in six family members and present in one. Sequencing analysis revealed a missense heterozygous mutation 1516G > T (Gly17Val) in exon 2 of the AVP-NPII gene among the ADNDI individuals.', 'output': 'We identified a missense mutation in the AVP-NPII gene and the same mutation showed different spectra of age of onsets and urine volumes in a new Chinese family with ADNDI. The mutation may provide a molecular basis for understanding the characteristics of NPII and add to our knowledge of the pathogenesis of ADNDI, which would allow the presymptomatic diagnosis of asymptomatic subjects.', '__index_level_0__': 26738}\n",

Since most of the diabetics are hyperglycemic much before they develop full-blown diabetes, we felt, it would be very important to know the effects of acute hyperglycemia on nerve function so that early pathophysiological events could be understood and appropriate therapeutic intervention can be made. Moreover, effect of acute hyperglycemia on motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and nerve blood flow (NBF) is not known. Hence, we studied the effects of acute hyperglycemia on sciatic MNCV and sciatic NBF in healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Three different animal models of acute hyperglycemia (50% glucose (3 g kg(-1), i.v. (intra-venous) or i.p. (intra-peritoneally)) or 24 h post-streptozotocin (STZ) injected rats were used. Acute hyperglycemia but not mannitol or sucrose significantly attenuated MNCV and NBF.

Apoptosis is generally characterized by reduced cell volume and cytosolic pH, but epithelial cells are relatively resistant to shrinkage due to regulatory volume increase, which is mediated by Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) 1. We investigated whether RTC apoptosis requires caspase cleavage of NHE1. Staurosporine- and hypertonic NaCl-induced RTC apoptosis was associated with cell shrinkage and diminished cytosolic pH, and apoptosis was potentiated by amiloride analogs, suggesting NHE1 activity opposes apoptosis. NHE1-deficient fibroblasts demonstrated increased susceptibility to apoptosis, which was reversed by NHE1 reconstitution. NHE1 expression was markedly decreased in apoptotic RTC due to degradation, and preincubation with peptide caspase antagonists restored NHE1 expression, indicating that NHE1 is degraded by caspases. Recombinant caspase-3 cleaved the in vitro-translated NHE1 cytoplasmic domain into five distinct peptides, identical in molecular weight to NHE1 degradation products derived from staurosporine-stimulated RTC lysates. In vivo, NHE1 loss-of-function C57BL/6.SJL-swe/swe mice with adriamycin-induced nephropathy demonstrated increased RTC apoptosis compared with adriamycin-treated wild-type controls, thereby implicating NHE1 inactivation as a potential mechanism of tubular atrophy.', 'output': 'contradiction', '__index_level_0__': 25947}\n",

However, it is currently unknown whether the decline in endothelial vasodilatation with advancing age is due to elevated ET-1 vasoconstrictor activity. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that the age-related impairment in ACh (acetylcholine)-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilatation is due, at least in part, to increased ET-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone. FBF (forearm blood flow) responses to ACh, SNP (sodium nitroprusside) and BQ-123 (ET(A) receptor blocker) were determined in 14 young (age, 25 ± 1 years) and 14 older (age, 61 ± 2 years) healthy non-obese men. Additionally, FBF responses to ACh were determined in the presence of ETA blockade. Vasodilatation to ACh was lower (approx. 25%; P<0.05) in the older men (from 4.9 ± 0.2 to 13.9 ± 0.9 ml·100 ml(-1) of tissue·min(-1)) compared with the young men (4.6 ± 0.3 to 17.2 ± 1.0 ml·100 ml(-1) of tissue·min(-1)).

controlled study for mrsa nosocomial pneumonia , lzd showed better clinical efficacy and microbiological responses than vancomycin . \\n rayner et al .   reported that higher success rates for lzd may occur at auc24/mic values of 80120 for bacteremia , skin and skin structure infections , and lower respiratory tract infections . \\n in this case , on day  50 , the urine culture developed mrsa 10/colony -

therapeutic levels of lzd blood concentrations may be caused by uncontrolled di with high crcl and a high level of fluid administration . in spite of the low level of auc24/mic , mrsa pneumonia and bacteremia \\n were successfully treated with lzd . as this was a retrospective study , we were unable to evaluate the concentration of lzd on days  6068 after the 1-h lzd administration for the pk assessment . \\n we must further study the actual pk assessment of lzd in patients with high crcl caused by di . \\n further investigation is required into the mechanisms of low lzd auc24/mic and the successful treatment of these mrsa infections . \\n below is the link to the electronic supplementary material . \\n supplementary material 1 ( pdf 243  kb ) supplementary material 1 ( pdf 243  kb ) \\n yoshihiko nakamura , masanobu uchiyama , shuuji hara , mariko mizunuma , takafumi nakano , hiroyasu ishikura , kota hoshino , yasumasa kawano , and tohru takata have nothing to disclose . \\n informed consent was obtained from the patient s family in relation to his being included in the study . \\n this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution -

based products that recently are getting attention can be applied to women 's diseases as therapies . \\n resveratrol ( trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene ) , a polyphenol - based substance , has been investigated since its effects on anti - oxidation , anti - inflammation , and neuroprotection have been reported to ameliorate the oxidative stress implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.15 resveratrol is a type of phytoalexin that a large number of plants produce in order to protect themselves against the environmental challenges such as bacteria . \\n to date it has been reported that resveratrol is found in about 70 species of plants including grapes , mulberry , and peanuts , and particularly relatively large amounts of resveratrols are produced from seeds and skins of grapes with high contents of sugars to protect against pathogens like vitis vinifera.161718 it has been well known that resveratrol plays a pivotal role on inhibition of apoptotic cell death manifested in various diseases through chemopreventive effect to control endoplasmic reticulum stress as well as mitochondrial oxidative stress.171920 recently it was also found that resveratrol has not only a protective effect against heart disease,21 but also a variety of anti - cancer efficacies on different cancers including breast cancer based on in vivo experimental data.22 \\n goji berry is the fruit of lycium barbarum and lycium chinese and has been used for a long time as a traditional chinese medication because it exhibits a variety of effects.23 recently it was demonstrated that polysaccharides extracted from lycium barbarum fruits are able to neutralize free radicals through a strong antioxidant effect derived from their hydrogen donating capacity.24 given that lycium barbarum extracts have been proved to stabilize blood sugar as well as lipid metabolism by studying with diabetes animal models , it has been proposed that goji berry can be utilized as therapeutic materials to treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease.2526 in addition , polysaccharides extracted from lyceum barbarum fruit have been shown to have a therapeutic effect for osteoporosis via increases of bone mineral density and bone mineral content.27 \\n as the name implies , chinese motherwort also known as leonurus japonicus houtt is well known to have beneficial effects for women in oriental herbal therapies and especially because of its high contents of vitamins as well as the effect of uterine contraction , the study of chinese motherwort has been focused on its beneficial effect for pregnant women.28 recent studies using rat models found that chinese motherwort extracts inhibit acetylcholine - induced relaxation , resulting in inducing vasoconstriction , consequently suggesting that chinese motherwort should be effective for treatment of cardiovascular disease.29 the solvent extract of chinese motherwort has been reported to have anti - cancer effects to inhibit the cell proliferation through regulating cytotoxicity and cycle arrest.30 by studying with rat models , it has been also demonstrated that treatment with leonurus heterophyllus extracts decreases the neutrophil accumulation in cerebral cortex of the brain , consequently inducing neuroprotection by decreasing cerebral ischemic damage.31 schmidt et al.32 also demonstrated that the insulin secretion ability of ins-1e cells increases by treatment with leonurus sibiricus extracts , suggestive of their application as a potential therapeutic agent for diabetes . \\n various types of annona have been utilized as traditional mexican medicines because of their activities of anti - anxiety , anticonvulsant , and tranquilizing effect . furthermore since it has been found that the annona contains abundant alkaloid - based compounds which are able to bind to 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1a ( 5-ht1a ) , inducing dopamine production.33 recent studies demonstrated that the aerial parts of annona cherimolia have a strong antidepressant effect and by high performance liquid chromotagraphy ( hplc ) analysis 1,2-dimethoxy-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-4h - dibenzoquinoline-3,8,9,10-tetrol , anonaine , nornuciferine , and liriodenine \\n are contained in annona cherimolia , suggesting that it can be utilized as a new antidepressant.34 \\n shiraia bambusicola is a fungus that is parasitic on twigs of bamboo and is widely grown in southern china and japan.35 it is reported that shiraia bambusicola extracts have been derived by treatment with 95% ethanol , followed by consecutive purification into four fractions . \\n these extracts have been used to treat angiogenesis - related diseases.36 recently it has been shown that an active ingredient shiraiachrome a not only has a strong effect of anti - angiogenesis but also inhibits autophosphorylation of four receptor tyrosine kinases , which consequently suggesting that shiraiachrome a can be used as anti - cancers and therapeutic material for rheumatoid arthritis.36\", 'output': \"women 's health has been threatened by various diseases mainly including heart disease , breast cancer , osteoporosis , depression , and autoimmune disease . but development of medication for these diseases has been restricted by high development costs and low success rates . herein the attempt to develop valid bioactive materials from a traditional natural material has been made . \\n resveratrol has been reported to be effective in treatment of breast cancer and heart disease . \\n goji berry has received attention as a natural based therapeutic material to treat a diabetes , cardiovascular disease , and osteoporosis . \\n leonurus family has been reported to be effective particularly in pregnant women due to high contents of vitamin as well as stimulation of uterine contraction . \\n annona family has effects such as anti -

capillary network \\n in the lung33 , 34 moreover , it may attenuate reduced pulmonary elastic recoil . thus , \\n the decrease in hba1c may have improved the lung function of the subjects after the ase \\n training in this study . \\n it is known that normal lung mechanics and gas exchange are affected by the integrity of \\n pulmonary connective tissue and microvasculature . \\n abnormalities in either of these two \\n structural components of the lung may result in the development of pulmonary \\n dysfunction34 . in a previous report \\n , it \\n was reported that a 10% decrease in fev1 was related to a 12% increase in \\n all - cause mortality8 . \\n the measured airflow \\n limitation is expected to increase all - cause mortality in patients with diabetes . \\n rigorous \\n blood management may reduce the risk of death through improved ventilatory function \\n independent of other beneficial effects . the ase decreased obesity and increased the dynamic lung volumes . \\n the fact that a reduction \\n in body fat or obesity improved the pulmonary functions after the ase training in this study \\n is consistent with many previous studies investigating low - intensity exercise training in \\n patients with diabetes24 , patients with \\n metabolic syndrome20 , and obese \\n subjects35 . \\n moreover , miyatake , et \\n al.36 reported that reduction of body \\n fat by low - intensity exercise in obesity leads to increased lung elasticity , which is \\n reflected in improvements in fev1 , fvc , and mvv . \\n the presence of extensive \\n microvascular circulation and abundant connective tissue in the lungs raises the possibility \\n that lung tissue may be affected by a microangiopathy process and nonenzymatic glycosylation \\n of tissue proteins . \\n the decrease in body fat in this study may be due to increased fat oxidation during the \\n exercise . \\n although we did not measure fat oxidation during the exercise , previous studies \\n support this finding25 , 37 . \\n ( 2002 ) demonstrated that \\n low - intensity exercise contributed to increased fat oxidation during exercise in obese \\n subjects . \\n our previous study showed that fat was mostly used as an energy source during \\n low - intensity exercise compared with higher - intensity exercise in young lean thai \\n individuals25 . \\n the reason for this \\n result could be due to a lower rate of glycolysis resulting in lower malonyl coa production \\n from a low level of muscle contraction during low - intensity exercise . \\n malonyl coa inhibits \\n carnitine palmitoyl transferase ( cpt ) , which carries free fatty acid into mitochondria for \\n fat oxidation38 . therefore , with a lower \\n level of malonyl coa , more fat is taken up and oxidized during the exercise . \\n however , we did \\n not measure the amount of fat oxidation or the fat source that was used during the exercise . \\n instead , we used lipid profiles from routine clinical investigation to indicate the source \\n of fat in the blood stream during rest in this study , and it was found that it was unchanged \\n by the ase . \\n free fatty acids from either adipocytes or intramuscular triglycerides may be \\n the source of fat involved in the increased fat oxidation during exercise in this study . \\n thus , further research investigating fat oxidation and the fat source during the ase needs \\n to be performed . in summary , the present results indicate that the ase can be an alternative mode of \\n exercise to reduce pulmonary function impairment of t2 dm patients , especially pulmonary \\n function impairment . \\n this reduction of pulmonary function impairment as a result of the ase \\n may be due to the improvement of hyperglycemia and fat metabolism and the decrease in \\n percent body fat .', 'output': '[ purpose ] obesity and hyperglycemia play roles in the impairment of pulmonary function in \\n type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) patients . \\n low - intensity exercise is known to reduce body \\n fat and improve hyperglycemia . \\n the arm swing exercise ( ase ) , a low - intensity exercise , is \\n easy and convenient to perform without any equipment and is suitable for daily practice . \\n therefore , we aimed to investigate the effects of ase on lung function and obesity in \\n overweight t2 dm patients . \\n [ subjects and methods ] twenty -

that is , a prolonged bloating sensation and visible abdominal distension , which had lasted for a month . \\n she received a thorough examination at our hospital 's internal medicine department , including various blood tests ; imaging examinations , such as ct and mammography ; upper and lower endoscopy ; and cytoscreening ( a biochemical examination ) of her ascites . \\n the differential diagnosis process particularly focused on autoimmune connective tissue disorders in addition to a further examination for occult primary cancer . \\n the patient 's laboratory data were indicative of anemia , thrombocytopenia , low serum albumin levels , kidney dysfunction , and subclinical hypothyroidism , but no autoantibodies associated with autoimmune connective tissue disorders were detected ( table 2a  b ) . \\n a ct scan showed a small to moderate amount of pleural effusion , a large amount of ascites , enlargement of both axillary lymph nodes , and multiple sclerotic bone lesions , but did not detect any tumors of the parenchymal organs or lymphadenopathy ( fig . \\n c ) . diagnostic aspiration indicated that the patient 's ascites ( table 3 ) was transudative , but not malignant . \\n a breast ultrasound scan detected a hypoechoic solid tumor ( size : ~1 cm ) containing internal echogenic spots with interruption of both the anterior and posterior borders of the mammary gland ( fig . \\n therefore , an ultrasoundguided needle biopsy was performed , leading to a histopathological diagnosis of hormone receptorpositive invasive ductal carcinoma without human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ( her2 ) protein overexpression ( fig . \\n although the diagnostic aspiration did not provide conclusive evidence of malignant effusion , after reflecting on the patient 's pathological characteristics , the physicians made a final diagnosis of stage iv / metastatic breast cancer with metastases involving the pleural cavity , peritoneal cavity , lymph nodes , and bone . \\n the patient began receiving tamoxifenbased hormonal therapy because chemotherapy was deemed inappropriate due to coexisting renal impairment . 1 month later , it became difficult for the patient to live at home because her massive ascites induced a bloating sensation accompanied by pain , shortness of breath , a diminished appetite , nausea , severe fatigue , and edema of the lower extremities . \\n therefore , she was admitted to our surgical ward in order to undergo peritoneal portcatheter placement to manage her refractory ascites . \\n laboratory findings.(a ) abnormal laboratory data obtained on admission and the changes in these parameters after chemotherapy treatment . \\n ( b ) a list of the autoantibodies associated with autoimmune connective tissue disorders that were tested for on admission bun : blood urea nitrogen , tsh : thyroidstimulating hormone , ft3 : free triiodothyronine , ft4 : free thyroxine , rnp : ribonucleoprotein , ssa : sjgren 's syndromerelated antigen a , anca : antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies , tpo : thyroid peroxidase . \\n [ correction added on 21 march 2016 after first online publication : the units in tables 2 and 3 were incorrect and have been updated in this version ] \\n ct scan obtained on admission . \\n bilateral axillary lymph node enlargement ( white arrows ) , ( b ) . a large amount of ascites , and ( c ) . a bone sclerotic lesion in the pubic symphysis ( white arrow ) . \\n the results indicated that the ascites was transudative , but not malignant [ correction added on 21 march 2016 after first online publication : the units in tables 2 and 3 were incorrect and have been updated in this version ] imaging studies of the right breast . \\n a breast ultrasound detected a hypoechoic solid tumor ( size : ~1 cm ) containing internal echogenic spots with interruption of both anterior and posterior border of the mammary gland ( white arrows ) . \\n histopathological examinations of the right breast an ultrasoundguided needle biopsy detected hormone receptorpositive invasive ductal carcinoma without human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ( her2 ) protein overexpression . \\n the surgeon who performed the physical examination on admission ( the lead author of this article ) noted that the patient had several characteristic physical findings : clubbing and hyperpigmentation of the fingers ( fig . \\n 4b ) ; and polyneuropathy , for example , numbness in both fingers , an inability to sense vibrations in both upper extremities , muscle weakness , and diminished deep tendon reflexes . \\n the detection of these characteristic physical findings triggered a fundamental review of the previous diagnosis , which required us to reexamine whether the patient 's breast cancer had played a causal role in the development of her pleural effusion , ascites , axillary lymphadenopathy , and sclerotic bone lesions . \\n when we considered all of the patient 's findings ( other than the breast cancer ) in a comprehensive manner , the differential diagnoses were divided into the following three categories : 1 hematological disorders , such as multiple myeloma , poems syndrome , monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance , waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia , cryoglobulinemia , and amyloidosis ; 2 immunemediated peripheral neuropathies , such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ; and 3 autoimmune connective tissue disorders , such as scleroderma . \\n however , autoimmune connective tissue disorders had already been ruled out , as mentioned above . on the other hand , the patient 's physical findings ; that is , the skin and neurological manifestations , represented valuable clues and led to an indepth examination for poems syndrome . skin changes ( a ) . \\n finger clubbing with hyperpigmentation ( b ) hyperpigmentation of the back with angiomas to examine whether the patient met the major criteria for poems syndrome ( table 1 ) , we performed an iliac crest bone marrow biopsy , a test for mprotein , and a nerve conduction velocity ( ncv ) test . \\n the bone marrow biopsy showed normal cellularity and did not detect any bone marrow plasma cell involvement , which excluded multiple myeloma . \\n 5 ) , and the ncv test demonstrated both demyelination and axonopathy in the right upper extremities ( table 4 ) , which were considered to be comorbidities of the patient 's peripheral polyneuropathy . \\n thereby , the diagnostic criteria for poems syndrome were fulfilled because one element of the other three major criteria ( sclerotic bone lesions ) and three of the minor criteria ( lymphadenopathy , extravascular volume overloading , and skin changes ) had already been met . \\n in addition , we obtained further strong evidence to support this diagnosis ; that is , a markedly raised vegf level ; the patient 's plasma and serum vegf levels were 555 pg / ml and 1530 pg / ml , respectively . \\n it has been reported that a plasma vegf level of 200 pg / ml exhibits 95% specificity and 68% sensitivity for diagnosing poems syndrome 3 . according to the japanese diagnostic criteria for poems syndrome issued by the japan intractable diseases information center \\n , a significantly elevated vegf level is defined as a serum level of > 1000 ng / ml 4 . \\n therefore , we were able to make a definitive diagnosis of poems syndrome in this rare case , which also involved synchronous breast cancer \\n a ncv study of the patient 's right side ncv , nerve conduction velocity . as a reference , \\n 22 this test detected mixed neuropathy in the median motor nerve and ulnar motor nerve ( a long latency , low amplitude , and low ncv ) , and axonal neuropathy in the right ulnar sensory nerve ( a low ncv ) . \\n the ncv of the median sensory nerve , tibial motor nerve , peroneal motor nerve , and sural sensory nerve were unmeasurable . immediately after the final diagnosis , \\n the patient began receiving chemotherapy based on a regimen for multiple myeloma ( 1.3 mg / m bortezomib , sc , on days 1 , 8 , 22 , and 29 of each cycle and 20 mg dexamethasone , po , on days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 22 , 23 , 29 , and 30 of each cycle ; each cycle lasted 6 weeks ) 5 as her condition was becoming increasingly lifethreatening . \\n after two courses of chemotherapy , the patient 's pleural effusion and ascites had almost disappeared , and her plasma and serum vegf levels fell significantly to 47 pg / ml and 266 pg / ml , respectively ; that is , below the diagnostic cutoff values of 200 pg / ml and 1000 pg / ml , respectively , indicating that these symptoms had been caused not by cancerous dissemination , but by poems syndrome . with the decreasing extravascular volume overload , her circulating plasma volume increased , leading to an improvement in her kidney function ( see table 2a ) , for example , her estimated glomerular filtration rate improved from 18 ml / min to 28 ml / min . \\n thus , the patient 's condition had improved markedly , and she was well enough to undergo a radical operation for breast cancer under general anesthesia . \\n a histopathological examination of the resected specimens detected a 10  5 mmsized invasive ductal carcinoma with no lymph node involvement ( 0/19 ) . when investigating the dissected axillary lymph nodes for poems syndrome , \\n none of the following histopathological features of castleman 's disease were detected : hyaline vascular , plasmacytic , or mixed lymph node features . \\n , adjuvant endocrine therapy ( 5 years ' tamoxifen treatment ) was considered sufficient . after receiving several more cycles of the same chemotherapy regimen , \\n the patient is scheduled to receive an autologous stem cell transplant in the near future , which is expected to result in a substantial improvement in her neuropathy 7 \\n 8 . \\n poems syndrome was first reported by crow in 1956 9 and was subsequently described by fukase in 1969 10 . \\n the acronym poems was coined by bardwick in 1980 11 and stands for the five main features of the disease ; that is , polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal gammopathy , and skin changes . \\n the syndrome was also referred to as crow  fukase syndrome by nakanishi in 1984 based on a japanese study of 102 cases 12 , and this name is more widely known in japan than poems syndrome . \\n although the pathophysiology of poems syndrome is poorly understood , the production of various inflammatory cytokines , such as interleukins ( il1 and il6 ) and vegf , by abnormal plasma cells is postulated to play a direct causal role in various symptoms of the condition 13 , 14 . in particular , \\n vegf levels exhibit the strongest correlations with disease activity in poems syndrome 3 , 15 . \\n plasma and serum vegf levels of 200 pg / ml and 1,000 pg / ml , respectively , are considered to be diagnostic cutoff values for poems syndrome . \\n elevated vegf levels are postulated to be involved in the pathogenesis of enhanced vascular permeability , increased endoneurial pressure , and the deposition of plasma cellderived material 14 , 16 , 17 , which eventually cause a variety of symptoms , including extravascular volume overloading ( edema , pleural effusion , and/or ascites ) , polyneuropathy ( demyelination ) , sclerotic bone lesions , and skin changes 18 , 19 . \\n however , the mixed results seen with antivegf therapy indicate that vegf might not be the driver of the clinical manifestations of poems syndrome 20 . \\n further studies of this issue are required . to the best of our knowledge ( based on a search of the pubmed database ) , this is the first case report about a case of poems syndrome with synchronous breast cancer . using \\n poems syndrome  and  synchronous cancer  as search keywords , we did not find any relevant articles ( accessed oct 19 , 2015 ) . at present \\n , there is no evidence that certain types of cancer are strongly associated with poems syndrome . \\n thus , it is likely that the current patient developed poems syndrome and breast cancer synchronously by chance . \\n the following three major factors might help to explain the diagnostic difficulties encountered in the present case . \\n first , poems syndrome is a rare disease ; its prevalence rate was reported to be 0.3 per 100,000 in japan 17 . however , there is another fact that some patients with poems syndrome are first diagnosed at autopsy or go undiagnosed unless properly autopsied because of diagnostic challenges specific to the syndrome 21 , which makes the actual prevalence rate unclear . \\n second , many of the signs and symptoms of poems syndrome mimic those of other disorders , leading to confusion and difficulties during the diagnostic process . \\n especially when being diagnosed with a certain type of cancer before the detection of preexisting poems syndrome , pleural effusion , ascites , lymphadenopathy , and bone lesions might be considered to be carcinomatous in origin . \\n the risk of such mistakes is probably higher in cases involving a metastasisprone cancer , for example , breast cancer . \\n third , clinicians have recently appeared to rely excessively on laboratory findings and/or imaging studies during the diagnostic process . \\n the present case should act as a warning against this unfavorable trend and could yield a bitter but helpful lesson that ,  the more complex a disease is , the more important a physical examination tends to be  .\", 'output': 'key clinical messagepolyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal gammopathy , skin changes ( poems ) syndrome is a rare plasma cell disorder that causes a paraneoplastic syndrome . \\n we report the first case of poems syndrome with synchronous breast cancer . \\n the patient was at risk of being misdiagnosed with metastatic cancer , and it is important to emphasize that physical examinations provided vital diagnostic clues .', '__index_level_0__': 26907}\n",

induced ischemia by treadmill or nuclear testing , a history of coronary artery revascularization or a diagnosis of chd by an internist or a cardiologist . \\n subjects were excluded if they had a history of myocardial infarction in the prior 6 months , could not walk one block or were planning to move from the local area within 3 years . \\n the majority of participants spoke english ; a small number of non - english - speaking patients participated through the assistance of an english - speaking family member . \\n after 315 participants had already been enrolled , additional funding enabled us to add instruments measuring doctor - patient communication as described below . \\n of the 709 remaining participants , 703 answered one or more questions about doctor - patient communication and were included in this cross - sectional study . \\n all subjects completed a day - long initial visit that involved an extensive structured questionnaire to measure demographic variables , medical comorbidities and psychosocial functioning , a resting echocardiogram and an exercise treadmill test with stress echocardiography . \\n the protocol was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards , and all participants provided written informed consent . \\n we assessed doctor - patient communication using the two - item explanations of condition subscale and the four - item responsiveness to patient preferences subscale from the interpersonal processes of care ( ipc ) instrument , an established self - report questionnaire designed to measure specific components of doctor - patient communication in diverse populations.2 details of the reliability and validity of the ipc instrument have been published previously.2 the questionnaire was self - administered with a research assistant available in the same room to help patients understand and interpret questions as necessary . \\n the explanations of condition subscale consisted of two questions :  how often did your doctor(s ) give you enough information about your health problems ?  and  how often did your doctor(s ) make sure you understood your health problems ? \\n the responsiveness to patient preferences subscale consisted of four questions :  how often did your doctor(s ) try to involve you or include you in decisions about your treatment ? \\n how often did your doctor(s ) ask how you felt about different treatments ?  how often did your doctor(s ) make decisions without taking your preferences or opinions into account ?  and  how often did you feel pressured by your doctor(s ) to have a treatment you were nt sure you wanted ?  for each question , patients were asked to report their experiences with their physician over the past 6  months on a five - point likert scale ranging from  never  to  always .  we generated a summary score for each subscale by adding up the total scores within the subscale and dividing by the number of questions . for participants who did not complete all questions in the subscale ( n  =  6 for explanations of condition and n  =  79 for responsiveness to patient preferences ) , we divided by the number of answered questions . \\n higher scores indicate better experiences of doctor - patient communication ( the likert scale was reverse scored for negative characteristics ) . \\n we evaluated the ipc subscales both as continuous variables and as dichotomous variables , with a score of < 4 on each subscale ( corresponding to never / rarely / sometimes for positive characteristics and always / often / sometimes for negative characteristics ) considered  poor  doctor - patient communication.26 we assessed depressive symptoms using the nine - item patient health questionnaire ( phq).27,28 we evaluated depressive symptoms both as a continuous variable ( range of scores 0 to 27 ) and as an ordinal variable , using previously established categories of none - minimal ( phq score of 03 ) , mild ( phq score of 49 ) or moderate - severe ( phq score 10 ) depressive symptoms.28 medical comorbidities ( history of hypertension , diabetes and myocardial infarction ) were assessed by patient questionnaire . \\n we assessed disease severity using three objective measures of cardiac function : a resting two - dimensional echocardiogram for measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ) , an exercise treadmill test for measurement of exercise capacity and a stress echocardiogram for assessment of inducible ischemia . \\n we performed a symptom - limited , graded exercise treadmill test according to a standard bruce protocol , a widely adopted and validated measure of exercise capacity and ischemic heart disease.29 peak exercise capacity was defined as the total number of metabolic equivalent tasks ( mets ) achieved . \\n poor exercise capacity was defined a priori as < 5 mets.30 inducible ischemia was defined as the presence of exercise - induced electrocardiographic changes or new echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities at peak exercise . \\n education was measured by asking participants  what is the highest level of education that you have completed ?  participants who indicated grade 12 ( or equivalent ) or higher were considered to have a high school education . \\n income was measured by asking participants  which of the following categories best describes your total combined household income for the past 12  months ?  primary care site was determined from administrative data . \\n our goal was to examine the associations of medical comorbidities , disease severity and depressive symptoms with patient reports of doctor - patient communication . \\n in univariate analyses , we compared differences in characteristics of participants ( including demographic variables , medical comorbidities , disease severity and depressive symptoms ) in patients with low ( poor communication ) vs. high ( good communication ) ipc subscale scores . \\n chi - squared tests were used for dichotomous variables and t tests for continuous variables . \\n we then used logistic regression to evaluate the independent association of depressive symptoms with  poor  reported doctor -

listed variables , mild depressive symptoms ( phq 49 ) were associated with a 60% increased odds of poor responsiveness to patient preferences ( or 1.6 , 95% ci 1.12.4 , p  =  0.01 ) , and moderate -

patient communication , as measured on two subscales from the established interpersonal processes of care questionnaire . \\n depressive symptoms were independently associated with poor reported explanations of condition and poor reported responsiveness to patient preferences , after adjustment for demographic factors , medical comorbidities and disease severity . in contrast , common medical comorbidities and objective measures of cardiac disease severity were not associated with reported doctor - patient communication . \\n these findings raise questions about whether self - reports of doctor - patient communication are in part a reflection of the psychological state of the patient . \\n patients with underlying mental disorders may be more likely to have unmet patient expectations,31 less likely to have their symptoms understood by their physicians,32 less involved in shared decision making33 and less satisfied with their care.34 to our knowledge , only one prior study has evaluated the influence of depressive symptom severity on patient reports of doctor - patient communication across different domains.24 this study , conducted in a cohort of adults with diabetes , found that depressive symptoms were associated with worse reports of doctor - patient communication on four out of seven subscales from the same interpersonal processes of care instrument . however , it was unclear how the association of depressive symptoms with poor reports of doctor - patient communication compared with medical comorbidities and objective measures of disease severity . \\n our study extends these important findings by reporting an association of depressive symptoms with reports of poor explanations of condition and responsiveness to patient preferences in a cohort of adults with chronic chd and by demonstrating that the association is not explained by medical comorbidities or worse cardiac function in depressed patients . \\n consistent with previous data , we found a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with chronic coronary disease.21,35,36 depression is a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes in this population . \\n patients with chd and concomitant depression are at increased risk for recurrence of cardiac events and for adverse cardiovascular outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery,21 independent of baseline cardiac disease severity.37 depression is associated with poor health - related quality of life in patients with chronic chd and more strongly predicts health status outcomes than objective measures of disease severity.25 our findings suggest that patients with depression are at increased risk for experiencing poor communication with their physicians . \\n poor experiences of doctor - patient communication  similar to poor perceived health status  may also lead to depressive symptoms . \\n the lack of association between medical comorbidities or disease severity and reports of poor communication implies that medical complexity may not compromise patients experiences of communication with their doctors to the same extent as depressive symptoms . \\n in addition to interventions focused on clinician communication skills , efforts to improve doctor - patient communication should include increased screening and treatment of patients with depressive symptoms . \\n referral to mental health services , when available , may assist primary care physicians in such evaluation and treatment . \\n physicians may also wish to explore different strategies for communicating information and sharing decisions with patients who are depressed . \\n poor experiences of communication in this population may signal a need for alternative communication models . \\n swenson hypothesized that differences in content , process or recall among patients with depression may result in poor communication.24 content refers to the challenge of dealing with multiple issues during a medical visit , which could lead to less time - sharing information . \\n our findings do not support the content explanation because communication was not associated with medical comorbidities or cardiac function . \\n the fact that sicker patients did not report worse communication suggests that visit content did not interfere with information exchange or shared decision making . \\n depressed patients may have difficulty discussing their health problems with physicians,22 have a more negative affect , be less well - liked by their doctors38 and/or make physicians feel more frustrated or less engaged,18 thereby placing a strain on interpersonal relationships , which may impede physician - patient communication . \\n visit recall means that depressed patients may have inaccurate or skewed recollections of what happened during a visit . \\n depressed patients may report poor communication in part because they view everything in a negative light . alternatively , difficulty with concentration , \\n a symptom of major depression,39 may impair patient recall of communication during the medical visit . while the process of communication may be objectively worse in patients with depressive symptoms , it is also possible that patients with depression perceive the same interactions differently . \\n depressive symptoms are associated with poor reports of doctor - patient communication , and the perceived quality of doctor - patient communication predicts patient satisfaction.40 thus , if patients with depressive symptoms report lower satisfaction with their physicians , is this because depressed patients perceive things differently or because their physicians are actually providing poorer quality care ? \\n the possibility that patients with depressive symptoms view clinical encounters through different lenses raises questions about the validity of patient self - report questionnaires used as measures of health - care quality . \\n first , we evaluated two aspects of doctor - patient communication , explanations of condition and responsiveness to patient preferences , using two subscales from the interpersonal processes of care instrument . \\n our study did not address other important components of doctor - patient communication including empathy , respectfulness , listening or empowerment.2,3,41 while explanations of condition and responsiveness to patient preferences are critical aspects of care , it is possible that the inclusion of additional measures of doctor - patient communication would have provided different results . \\n second , we studied patients with coronary heart disease , so our results may not generalize to patients with other illnesses . however , chd is a common chronic illness requiring frequent physician visits and associated with multiple medical comorbidities and high rates of depression . \\n third , it is possible that depression itself may have presented a barrier to participation in this study . \\n however , we found a high prevalence of depressive symptoms consistent with previous data.36 fourth , our participants spoke english , and the majority were male and white . although the interpersonal processes of care instrument was designed to compare doctor - patient communication across diverse racial / ethnic groups , our study sample did not allow us to make such comparisons . \\n fifth , we did not collect information about individual physicians . while previous work has demonstrated an association between physician characteristics and patient reports of doctor - patient communication,42 we were unable to evaluate physician predictors of communication or account for clustering at the physician level . \\n sixth , the interpersonal processes of care instrument is a patient self - report questionnaire ; we did not observe doctor - patient communication directly . \\n while patient perceptions of communication are important in and of themselves , direct observation might have allowed us to examine whether perceived differences in communication were more strongly associated with visit process or recall . \\n finally , this was a cross - sectional study ; thus , we were unable to evaluate causality . \\n in summary , patients with depressive symptoms are more likely to report poor doctor - patient communication than those without depressive symptoms . whether differences in perceived communication are due to differences in the communication process or to differences in recall among patients with depressive symptoms deserves further study . \\n patient reports are important in and of themselves and signal a need for increased awareness of the influence of depressive symptoms on experiences of doctor - patient communication . \\n however , further correlation with physician reports and/or direct observation may be necessary before such reports can be used as objective measures of health - care quality .', 'output': 'backgrounddoctor - patient communication is an important marker of health - care quality . \\n little is known about the extent to which medical comorbidities , disease severity and depressive symptoms influence perceptions of doctor - patient communication in patients with chronic disease.methodsin a cross - sectional study of 703 outpatients with chronic coronary disease , we evaluated the extent to which patient reports of doctor - patient communication were influenced by medical comorbidities , disease severity and depressive symptoms . \\n we assessed patient reports of doctor - patient communication using the explanations of condition and responsiveness to patient preferences subscales from the  interpersonal processes of care  instrument . \\n poor doctor - patient communication was defined as a score of < 4 ( range 1 to 5 ) on either subscale . \\n all patients completed the nine - item patient health questionnaire ( phq ) for measurement of depressive symptoms and underwent an extensive evaluation of medical comorbidities and cardiac function.resultsin univariate analyses , the following patient characteristics were associated with poor reported doctor - patient communication on one or both subscales : female sex , white or asian race and depressive symptoms . after adjusting for demographic factors , medical comorbidities and disease severity , \\n each standard deviation ( 5.4-point ) increase in depressive symptom score was associated with a 50% greater odds of poor reported explanations of condition ( or 1.5 , 95% ci , 1.21.8 ; p  <  0.001 ) and a 30% greater odds of poor reported responsiveness to patient preferences ( or 1.3 , 95% ci , 1.11.5 ; p  =  0.01 ) . \\n in contrast , objective measures of disease severity ( left ventricular ejection fraction , exercise capacity , inducible ischemia ) and medical comorbidities ( hypertension , diabetes , myocardial infarction ) were not associated with reports of doctor -

Below is my query and your answer - I am a male of 48 years of age. I have a lean build and do regular exercise. Since childhood, I had a tendency for heart palpitations and premature beats. After a few tests, anxiety was found to be the main cause.  You had said that most probably these premature complexes are originating from ventricles which are leading to the symptoms. These are usually benign and not life threatening. The only concern remains is that of coronary artery disease, which is also less likely as these are occurring from a long time and you are not having any other symptoms. Lack of sleep, stress, alcohol, smoking, caffeinated beverages are known triggering factors for these due to sympathetic overactivity. You should also get thyroid test done. I think, just be on a safer side, you should get one treadmill test done to rule out coronary artery disease and echo should be repeated. Afterwards, I met a cardiologist and got an ECG and echo tests done. The tests were normal. The cardiologist said that there is no need for TMT test since I do running and other exercises daily and there is no known risk factor for CAD. But the VPCs continued for a month.Then, I realized that I was taking a weight gainer supplement from the last one year which contained creatinine. Two months back, I was not doing any exercise due to a small fracture in my elbow but continued to take this supplement. The doctor advised me to stop the supplement immediately since this could be the cause of missed beats. Then I read in the internet and found out that there have been cases of irregular heart beats due to creatinine supplementation. I stopped taking the supplement although it was from a reputed firm and did not contain any steroids. The missed beats reduced after stopping the supplement and from the last two months, it has come to a normal level of one or two in a day. But somehow my mind started getting preoccupied with the thoughts of heart disease and I started reading about it from the internet and even textbooks.I have been thin and slim since my childhood, have been quite active physically, no family history of heart disease, no diabetes, no hypertension, non-smoker, rarely eat fried foods. My lipid profile is normal with HDL being about 55 whenever tested, CRP is around 0.5. But in spite of this, I was not able to free my mind from worries of CAD. A month back, I did quite a lot of pushups after a gap of four to five months. After three to four days, I started having pain in my chest here and there mostly at rest. After a week I got an ECG done which was normal. The pain subsided slowly but whenever I did some exercise which put a strain on the chest muscle I started having pain and with pain, more worries.Then I met a psychiatrist. He said that I have got into an obsessive loop, which is part of health anxiety disorder which is causing these psychosomatic symptoms of chest pain. He advised me to take some antidepressants for three months, do Yoga and meditation and take some sessions of cognitive behavior therapy. I am reluctant to take antidepressants but have already started doing some meditation and Yoga. He also prescribed Alprazolam .25 mg on SOS basis. Now the pain is subsiding slowly and obsessive thoughts are also reducing. I have stopped doing any exercise that would put a strain on the chest. I do not know how long it will take to resume it. In a recent blood test, two months back my vitamin D3 was at 28. Could it be the cause of the chest pain? Secondly, I stopped the supplement but continued some strenuous exercises without taking a proper diet. Could it be the cause of it? Please guide me. How to get rid of this unwanted health anxiety which I have got into?', 'output': 'Hello. Looking at the overall picture, the problem appears to be a minor one and not worrisome. All the best.
