Context: Macrovascular disease is an important cause of the increased morbidity and mortality rates associated with type 1 diabetes, and this vascular impairment begins in childhood. The aim of this study was to determine whether introducing intensive diabetes management [intensive insulin therapy (IIT) and 'Sweet Talk' text-messaging support] produces measurable improvements in endothelial function. One hundred and twenty-six patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria (type 1 diabetes for >1 year; on conventional insulin therapy (CIT); aged between 8 and 18 years), of whom 92 enrolled. Patients were randomised to group 1, CIT only (n=28); group 2, CIT and Sweet Talk (n=33); or group 3, IIT and Sweet Talk (n=31). Vascular assessments (including measures of endothelial damage, activation, dysfunction and oxidative stress) and HbA1c were performed at baseline and repeated after 12 months of the study. Glycaemic control deteriorated in patients on CIT, but improved significantly in patients allocated to IIT (p=0.007). IIT was associated with significantly greater improvements in E-selectin (p<0.0001) than CIT (group 1, p=0.026 and group 2, p=0.053). Vascular responses to acetylcholine improved in patients on IIT (p=0.017), but not in patients receiving CIT. These changes were all independent of HbA1c level.",

Context: To investigate the efficacy of topical applied aloe vera (AV) and to facilitate the repair of the standardized alkaline corneal ulcer in normal and diabetic rats. The corneal alkali-burn injury model was established unilaterally in Wistar rats by filter paper saturated with 0.01 M NaOH contacting the eyes for 45 seconds. Rats were divided into four groups: normal control (NC), normal AV (NAV), diabetic control (DC), and diabetic AV (DAV). NAV and DAV groups were treated with AV gel eye drops four times daily, and NC and DC groups were treated with normal saline for 3 days. Corneal epithelial wound closure and degree of edema were recorded using slit lamp and optical coherence tomography at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours postwounding. Histological examination was conducted to evaluate the degree of inflammation and the healing effect. Corneal epithelial wound healing was better in the NAV group than in the NC group, and it was significantly higher in the DAV group than in the DC group (P<0.05). In comparison to the DC group, DAV treated with AV demonstrated a marked reduction in edema at 48 and 72 hours.

Context: To explore factors related to hand pain in persons with radiographic hand osteoarthritis (OA). Persons in the Musculoskeletal Pain in Ullensaker Study with radiographic hand OA (≥1 joint with Kellgren/Lawrence grade ≥2) were included (n = 530). We examined the cross-sectional association between possible explanatory variables and hand pain in the entire sample and in 2 hand OA phenotypes (erosive versus nonerosive) using structural equation analyses. Outcome variables were the Australian/Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index (AUSCAN; range 0-20) and number of tender finger joints upon palpation (NTJ; range 0-30). The mean age was 65 years (40-79 years) and 375 participants were women (71%). Diabetes mellitus, female sex, lower education status, familial OA, infrequent alcohol drinking, widespread pain, poor mental health, and higher number of finger joints with ultrasound-detected synovitis and radiographic OA were related to more hand pain in the entire sample. Stratified analyses showed that diabetes mellitus was strongly associated with AUSCAN pain (B-unstandardized coefficient = 3.81 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.27, 5.35]) and NTJ (B-unstandardized coefficient = 4.16 [95% CI 2.01, 6.31]) in erosive hand OA only. In nonerosive OA, lower education status, having familial OA, and poor mental health were associated with hand OA pain. Widespread pain was associated with both outcomes in both phenotypes.",

Diabetes leads to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in association with an upregulation of vasoactive factors and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and activating protein-1. We therefore investigated the effect of Lagerstroemia speciosa on the activation of NF-kappaB as a key mediator of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, in rat cardiomyocyte H9c2 cells. Water extract of Lagerstroemia speciosa (Lythraceae family) was prepared. H9c2 cells were used for treatment of Lagerstroemia speciosa extract with/without tumor necrosis factor (TNF). To examine NF-kappaB's activation, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The activation of NF-kappaB by TNF was completely blocked by a Lagerstroemia speciosa extract in a dose- and time-dependent manner in H9c2 cells.",

Among women without a history of CVD or diabetes (n = 6327), 90% were found to have at least one major modifiable CVD risk factor, with one-third of women having three or more major risk factors. Nearly half of all women with elevated total cholesterol (> or = 200 mg/dL) or low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (< 50 mg/dL) did not report a known history of abnormal cholesterol. Among women with no history of hypertension, 16% had a blood pressure > or = 140/90 mm Hg. Unrecognized diabetes and glucose intolerance were striking among fasting women (n = 1218; 9% had a blood glucose > or = 126 mg/dL and 43% had a blood glucose > or = 100 mg/dL).

We examined the relationship between smoking and indicators of kidney damage in a healthy population without impaired fasting glucose levels, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension. This is a randomly selected, population-based, cross-sectional study of 11,247 Australian adults. Smoking status was determined by questionnaire. Subjects were tested for indicators of kidney damage: renal impairment by Cockcroft-Gault-estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and proteinuria by urine protein-creatinine ratio of 0.20 mg/mg or greater. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, smoking was significantly associated with renal impairment in men with an odds ratio of 3.59, but not in women. Smoking was significantly associated with proteinuria in subjects with high-normal systolic blood pressure, with odds ratios ranging from 3.64 at 131.5 mm Hg to 5.76 at 139.5 mm Hg, and in subjects with high-normal 2-hour glucose levels, with odds ratios ranging from 1.76 at 7.0 mmol/L to 10.84 at 7.7 mmol/L.

Healthy and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated with sodium tungstate (2 mg/ml in their drinking water) for 12 weeks. Markers of reproductive function and diabetes were measured in serum, and in uterus and ovaries by Western blot or RT-PCR. Reproductive function was also assessed by mating. Diabetic rats showed great impairment of libido, which was accompanied by a total loss of fertility (P < 0.05) and a decrease in the serum levels of FSH (P < 0.05) and LH (P < 0.05) compared with healthy rats. Tungstate treatment of diabetic rats partially recovered libido while fertility rate increased to 66.6%. This improvement was accompanied by a recovery of serum FSH (to a level higher than healthy rats) and LH. Moreover, tungstate treatment normalized ovarian expression of GLUT 3 hexose transporter, and estrogen, progesterone and FSH receptors, whereas only GLUT 3 and FSH receptors were normalized in the uterus.",

We estimated genetic ancestry in Latinos using STRUCTURE with the HapMap reference panels. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to test the relationship between the proportions of genetic ancestry and severe DR. Native American ancestry (NAA) in Latino T2DM subjects is associated significantly with severe DR (P = 0.002). The association remained significant (P = 0.005) after adjusting for age, sex, duration of diabetes, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, education, and income.

We aimed to investigate the association between plasma LBP and metabolic disorders in apparently healthy Chinese. A population-based study including 559 overweight/obese (BMI >or=24.0 kg/m(2)) and 500 normal-weight (18.0 <or= BMI <24.0 kg/m(2)) subjects aged 35-54 years was conducted in Shanghai, China. Fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile, LBP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin, leptin, hepatic enzymes, and body composition were measured. Metabolic syndrome was defined by the updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criterion for Asian Americans. LBP levels were significantly higher in overweight/obese individuals than in normal-weight individuals (geometric mean 27.6 [95% CI 25.2-30.3] vs. 10.0 [9.1-11.1] microg/ml; P < 0.001).

We hypothesized that changes in SGLT1 expression in the luminal membrane of ductal cell may be related to an altered salivary flow. By immunohistochemistry, we investigated SGLT1 expression in ductal cells of parotid and submandibular glands from Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), diabetic WKY (WKY-D), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and diabetic SHR (SHR-D), as well as in parotid glands from WKY subjected to sympathetic stimulation, with or without previous propranolol blockade. Diabetes and hypertension decreased the salivary secretion and increased SGLT1 expression in the luminal membrane of ductal cells, and their association exacerbated the regulations observed.

Context: In this study of 242 patients with renal failure, women, patients with diabetes, and patients on peritoneal dialysis had the highest risk of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency. Levels correlated positively to BMD Z scores, and hip BMD was inversely related to prevalent fracture. Increasing 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels may benefit these patients. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (<37 nM) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 (glomerular filtration rate < 15 ml/min/1.73 m(2) or on dialysis), but it is unclear if this deficiency is associated with bone disease and if supplementation is warranted. Blood samples were collected on 242 patients with CKD stage 5 caused by type 1 diabetes (33%), type 2 diabetes (2%), and other causes (65%), who were about to undergo kidney or kidney pancreas transplantation. Prevalent spinal fracture was assessed by X-ray and BMD by DXA. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was present in 28% of patients with diabetes versus 12% without (p < 0.0001). Patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) had lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D than patients on hemodialysis (HD; 49 +/- 26 versus 77 +/- 34 nM; p < 0.0001), and women had lower levels than men (51 +/- 25 versus 77 +/- 35 pM; p < 0.0001).

Microsatellite markers (D6S334, D6S286, D6S310, D6S308, D6S292, D6S311, and D6S403) and human leukocyte antigen DQ alleles were examined using polymerase chain reaction and DNA fragment electrophoresis in 3 patients with transient and 3 patients with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. Humoral markers of islet cell autoimmunity and clinical characteristics were analyzed in the 2 groups. A patient with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TND) and macroglossia carrying paternal uniparental isodisomy (UPD) of chromosome 6 has been identified. The isodisomy affected the whole chromosome; no maternal chromosome 6 sequences were detected. The permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus cases and the other 2 cases with TND did not have UPD. None of the patients had high-risk type 1 diabetes human leukocyte antigen DQ alleles and most infants were negative for islet cell-specific autoantibodies indicating that none of the 2 forms of neonatal diabetes mellitus is likely to be of autoimmune origin.

        "input": "Question: Is comorbid depression associated with an increased risk of dementia diagnosis in patients with diabetes : a prospective cohort study? Context: Both depression and diabetes have been found to be risk factors for dementia. This study examined whether comorbid depression in patients with diabetes increases the risk for dementia compared to those with diabetes alone. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 3,837 primary care patients with diabetes (mean age 63.2 +/- 13.2 years) enrolled in an HMO in Washington State. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression at baseline, and ICD-9 diagnoses for dementia were used to identify cases of dementia. Cohort members with no previous ICD-9 diagnosis of dementia prior to baseline were followed for a 5-year period. The risk of dementia for patients with both major depression and diabetes at baseline relative to patients with diabetes alone was estimated using cause-specific Cox proportional hazard regression models that adjusted for age, gender, education, race/ethnicity, diabetes duration, treatment with insulin, diabetes complications, nondiabetes-related medical comorbidity, hypertension, BMI, physical inactivity, smoking, HbA(1c), and number of primary care visits per month. Over the 5-year period, 36 of 455 (7.9%) patients with major depression and diabetes (incidence rate of 21.5 per 1,000 person-years) versus 163 of 3,382 (4.8%) patients with diabetes alone (incidence rate of 11.8 per 1,000 person-years) had one or more ICD-9 diagnoses of dementia. Patients with comorbid major depression had an increased risk of dementia (fully adjusted hazard ratio 2.69, 95% CI 1.77, 4.07).",

Context: To determined the relationship between perioperative glucose control and postoperative nosocomial infection rate is 100 consecutive diabetic patients undergoing elective surgery. One hundred initially uninfected diabetic patients undergoing elective surgery were prospectively monitored for perioperative glucose control and postoperative nosocomial infection rate. Glucose control was determined by the attending surgeon or diabetologist. A large tertiary care hospital that serves as the in-patient facility for a local diabetes center. All patients were screened for infection preoperatively. Only initially uninfected patients were enrolled, and all patients received perioperative antibiotic coverage. Perioperative glucose control and postoperative nosocomial infection rate were monitored prospectively. APACHE II scores were determined on all patients. Patients were stratified into two groups: those with relatively \"good\" perioperative glucose control (all values < or = 220 mg/dL) and those with \"poor\" control (at least one value > 220 mg/dL). Contingency tables were generated, comparing nosocomial infection rates vs perioperative glucose control. Correlation coefficients between APACHE II score and maximum and mean glucose values were also determined. A serum glucose > 220 mg/dL on postoperative day one (POD 1) was a sensitive (87.5%) but relatively nonspecific (33.3%) predictor of the later development of postoperative nosocomial infection. In patients with hyperglycemia (> 220 mg/dL) on POD 1, the infection rate was 2.7 times that observed (31.3% vs 11.5%) in diabetic patients with all serum glucose values < 220 mg/dL. When minor infection of the urinary tract was excluded, the relative risk for \"serious\" postoperative infection increased to 5.7 when any POD 1 blood glucose level was > 220 mg/dL. On the basis of correlation coefficients between serum glucose values and APACHE II score, only 18% of the variance in the highest serum glucose could be explained by disease severity alone.",

Context: Acute and chronic renal dysfunction (ARD, CRD) are common complications after liver transplantation and are associated with poor outcome. We reviewed the results of 181 liver transplants performed in our institution between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2000 in which the recipients were alive with good liver function at the end of the follow-up period (mean 2.7 years). Renal dysfunction was defined as a serum creatinine (Cr) greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL in both acute and chronic settings. The incidence of ARD during the first posttransplant week was 39.2% (n=71), whereas late CRD occurred in 6.0% (n=11) of the patients by the end of the follow-up period. Among the variables we examined for association with CRD, five factors were found to be statistically significant in univariate analysis: pretransplant diabetes (PRTDM) (0.000), Cr greater than or equal to 2 during the first postoperative week (0.003), posttransplant diabetes (POTDM) (0.014), age greater than 50 (0.025), and tacrolimus level greater than 15 ng/mL at postoperative day 15 (0.058). In binary logistic regression analysis, PRTDM (odds ratio [OR]=5.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]) and early postoperative ARD (OR=10.2 95% CI) remained consistently significant. Nine of 11 patients with CRD also had a history of ARD during the first postoperative week.

Context: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. ER stress activates the unfolded protein response pathway, which contributes to apoptosis and insulin resistance. We investigated the roles of cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A) in the regulation of hepatic ER stress, insulin resistance, and the development of diabetes in mice. We used mass spectrometry to compare levels of CYP450 proteins in livers from C57BL/6J and C57BL/KsJ-db/db (db/db) mice; findings were confirmed by immunoblot and real-time PCR analyses. To create a model of diet-induced diabetes, C57BL/6J mice were placed on high-fat diets. Mice were given intraperitoneal injections of an inhibitor (HET0016) or an inducer (clofibrate) of CYP4A, or tail injections of small hairpin RNAs against CYP4A messenger RNA; liver tissues were collected and analyzed for ER stress, insulin resistance, and apoptosis. The effect of HET0016 and CYP4A knockdown also were analyzed in HepG2 cells. Levels of the CYP4A isoforms were highly up-regulated in livers of db/db mice compared with C57BL/6J mice. Inhibition of CYP4A in db/db and mice on high-fat diets reduced features of diabetes such as insulin hypersecretion, hepatic steatosis, and increased glucose tolerance. CYP4A inhibition reduced levels of ER stress, insulin resistance, and apoptosis in the livers of diabetic mice; it also restored hepatic functions. Inversely, induction of CYP4A accelerated ER stress, insulin resistance, and apoptosis in livers of db/db mice.",

In this study, we explore patients' valuations and preferences for each attribute of telemedicine service for diabetes management and evaluate patient willingness to pay for specific service attributes. We conducted a conjoint survey to collect data on patients' stated preferences among telemedicine service alternatives. The alternatives for diabetes-related service differed in 10 attributes, including those related to price, type of service provider, and service scope. To estimate the relative importance of attributes, patients' willingness to pay for each attribute, and their probable choice of specific alternatives, we used a rank-ordered logit model. A total of 118 respondents participated in the survey. All 10 attributes significantly affected patients' valuations and preferences, and demographic and disease characteristics, such as existence of complications and comorbidities, significantly affected patients' valuations of the attributes. Price was the most important attribute, followed by comprehensive scope of service, the availability of mobile phone-based delivery, and large general-hospital provided services.",

The long term outcome of these patients after receiving intravenous immunoglobulin is unclear and the precise optimal regimen needed has yet to be ascertained. Moreover, the influence of chronic hyperglycaemia on this neuropathy is not clear. This prospective follow-up study included all consecutive patients with diabetes with a CIDP referred to our department during the 18 months of the study. 198 consecutive patients were referred to our neuromuscular unit and exhaustively screened. 16 patients with diabetes (8%) had a demyelinating polyneuropathy fulfilling the most restrictive diagnostic criteria for CIDP. They were treated with at least one course of intravenous immunoglobulin and, if responders, retreated in case of relapse. All patients were followed for at least 40 months. Patients with diabetes with CIDP significantly improved after immunotherapy and during follow-up. The Neuropathy Impairment Score changed from 38 at presentation to 16 at the end of the follow-up.

Context: Diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular complications including arrhythmias, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be established. Decreased conduction velocity (CV), which is an independent risk factor for re-entry arrhythmias, is present in models with streptozotocin (STZ) induced type 1 diabetes. Whether CV is also disturbed in models of type 2 diabetes is currently unknown. We used Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats, as a model of type 2 diabetes, and their lean controls Zucker Diabetic Lean (ZDL) rats to investigate CV and its response to the anti-arrhythmic peptide analogue AAP10. Gap junction remodeling was examined by immunofluorescence and western blotting. Cardiac histomorphometry was examined by Masson`s Trichrome staining and intracellular lipid accumulation was analyzed by Bodipy staining. CV was significantly slower in ZDF rats (56±1.9 cm/s) compared to non-diabetic controls (ZDL, 66±1.6 cm/s), but AAP10 did not affect CV in either group. The total amount of Connexin43 (C×43) was identical between ZDF and ZDL rats, but the amount of lateralized C×43 was significantly increased in ZDF rats (42±12 %) compared to ZDL rats (30±8%), p<0.04. Judged by electrophoretic mobility, C×43 phosphorylation was unchanged between ZDF and ZDL rats. Also, no differences in cardiomyocyte size or histomorphometry including fibrosis were observed between groups, but the volume of intracellular lipid droplets was 4.2 times higher in ZDF compared to ZDL rats (p<0.01).",

Context: Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) has a very high incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and admission rate for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The purpose of this study was to identify characteristics and precipitating factors associated with pediatric DKA in this population. This was a retrospective study on children diagnosed with DKA from 2007-2011 admitted to the province's only tertiary care pediatric hospital. Demographics, biochemical characteristics, and reasons for DKA diagnosis were analyzed. Chi-square and Fisher Exact tests were performed for categorical variables; t- and non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed for continuous variables. A total of 90 children were admitted with DKA (39.5% newly diagnosed; 60.5% were previously diagnosed). The rate of DKA on presentation for incident cases was 22.1%. More severe cases of DKA occurred in younger, newly diagnosed patients. Almost half of preexisting diabetes cases were recurrent DKA (49.1%). The most common presenting characteristics of newly diagnosed patients were weight loss, bedwetting, polyuria, polydipsia, and neurologic symptoms. Pre-existing diabetes patients most often presented with abdominal pain and vomiting. Diagnosis of diabetes in new patients and issues related to interrupted insulin delivery in pre-existing patients using insulin pump therapy were the most common factors associated with DKA. Of the newly diagnosed patients presenting in DKA, 64% had seen a physician in the weeks leading up to diagnosis.",

Context: Wogonin (5,7-dihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone), a major bioactive compound of the flavonoid family, is commonly extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Scutellaria baicalensis and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and is assumed to have anti-diabetes function. Indeed, a current study has shown that it can possibly treat metabolic disorders such as those found in db/db mice. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of wogonin on osteopontin (OPN) expression in adipose tissue from type 1 diabetic mice and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Type 1 diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) injection. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were converted to 3T3-L1 adipocytes through treatment with insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Western blot analysis and RT-PCR were performed to detect protein expression and mRNA levels, respectively. Wogonin treatment suppressed the increase in serum OPN levels and reduced OPN expression in adipose tissue from STZ-induced type 1 diabetic mice. Administration of wogonin enhanced PPARα expression and activity. Silencing of PPARα diminished the inhibitory effects of wogonin on OPN expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, the levels of c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun were reduced in wogonin-treated adipose tissue and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, wogonin treatment dramatically mitigated p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK by its specific inhibitor SB203580 increased PPARα activity and decreased OPN expression.",

Context: Statins may decrease serum testosterone levels via decreasing cholesterol, a precursor to testosterone. This case series studied the effects of rosuvastatin on free testosterone levels and sexual function in men with type 2 diabetes. We enrolled 151 men with type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. Biochemical assessments included serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, total testosterone and serum sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). All parameters were measured before statin treatment, after 6months of statin treatment, and 6months after discontinuing statin treatment. The Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) was also administered at these times. Serum TC and LDL levels were high before statin therapy, decreased after six months of statin therapy, and increased significantly six months after discontinuing statin therapy (198.1±28.1mg/dl vs. 147.1±22.8mg/dl vs. 205.2±25.6mg/dl, p-value<0.001; 121.3±20.6mg/dl vs. 75.4±20.4mg/dl vs.124.9±20mg/dl, p-value<0.001).

The ulcers were cleansed to remove exudates, and wound fluids were collected for analysis of MMP-2 and -9, TIMP-1, and TGF-beta1. At presentation, MMP-9 and the MMP-9-to-TIMP-1 ratio correlated inversely with the wound healing rate at 28 days (P < 0.001).

Context: Maternal-fetal transfer of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is impaired by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. MFSD2a was recently recognized as a lyso-phospholipid (lyso-PL) transporter that facilitates DHA accretion in brain. The role of this transporter in placenta is uncertain. We evaluated effects of GDM and its treatment (diet or insulin) on phospholipid species, fatty acid profile in women, cord blood and placental fatty acid carriers. Prospective observational study of pregnant women recruited in the third trimester (25 controls, 23 GDM-diet, 20 GDM-insulin). Fetal ultrasound was performed at gestational week 38. At delivery, maternal and neonatal anthropometry was performed, and fatty acids in total lipids and phospholipid species were analyzed in placenta, maternal and venous cord blood. Western-blot analyses were performed for placental fatty acid carriers. Fetal abdominal circumference z-score at 38 weeks tended to higher values in GDM (P = 0.071), pointing toward higher fetal fat accretion in these babies. DHA percentage in cord serum total lipids (P = 0.029) and lyso-PL (P = 0.169) were reduced in GDM. Placental MFSD2a was reduced in both GDM groups and was positively correlated to DHA values in cord serum total lipids (r = 0.388, P = 0.003).

In this study, we set out to determine whether the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism was associated with liver fibrosis in unselected patients with type 2 diabetes. Two hundred and thirty-four patients with type 2 diabetes were included in this study. LFC was evaluated using (1) H-MR spectroscopy; fibrosis was measured using the non-invasive FibroTest(®). Advanced liver fibrosis (stage F2 or above) was observed in 10.2% of the patients while 149 (63.6%) patients had steatosis. The prevalence of steatosis and fibrosis was higher in minor G allele carriers than that in C allele homozygote carriers (70.3 vs 57.1%; P=0.04 and 14.7 vs 7.5%; P=0.07 respectively).

        "input": "Question: Does tranilast attenuate the up-regulation of thioredoxin-interacting protein and oxidative stress in an experimental model of diabetic nephropathy? Context: Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of kidney failure in the developed world. Tranilast has been reported to not only act as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic compound, but it also exerts anti-oxidative stress effects in diabetic nephropathy. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) is the endogenous inhibitor of the anti-oxidant thioredoxin and is highly up-regulated in diabetic nephropathy, leading to oxidative stress and fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether tranilast exerts its anti-oxidant properties through the inhibition of Txnip. Heterozygous Ren-2 rats were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin. Another group of rats were injected with citrate buffer alone and treated as non-diabetic controls. After 6 weeks of diabetes, diabetic rats were divided into two groups: one group gavaged with tranilast at 200 mg/kg/day and another group with vehicle. Diabetic rats had a significant increase in albuminuria, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, peritubular collagen IV accumulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and macrophage infiltration (all P < 0.05). These changes were associated with an increase in Txnip mRNA and protein expression in the tubules and glomeruli of diabetic kidney. Treatment with tranilast for 4 weeks significantly attenuated Txnip up-regulation in diabetic rats and this was associated with a reduction in ROS, fibrosis and macrophage infiltration (all P < 0.05).",

Context: To examine the influence of dietary intake from various protein and fat sources on the occurrence of microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetic patients. In this nested case control study, 1,150 patients with diabetes duration >5 years reported dietary habits for the previous 12 months and submitted urinary samples for the analysis of albumin excretion rate (AER). A total of 75 cases of albuminuria (overnight AER > or = 15 microg/min) were identified and compared with 225 duration-matched control subjects. Neither mean protein, fat intake, average fish protein intake (control subjects 4.56 +/- 3.83 g/day and cases 3.82 +/- 2.87 g/day; P = 0.12), nor intake of meat and vegetable protein differed between the cases of albuminuria and the control subjects. High consumers of fish protein (greater than the 75th percentile) (12 cases and 63 control subjects, mean intake 9.35 g fish protein/day, i.e., approximately 53 g fish/day) had lower odds ratios (ORs) for microalbuminuria than individuals consuming less fish protein (mean 2.72 g/day) (crude OR 0.49 and 95% CI 0.25-0.97). When adjusted for known confounding factors, such as HbA1c, mean arterial pressure, diabetes duration, age, sex, smoking, BMI, country region, and total energy, individuals with a high intake of fish protein and fish fat showed a reduction in the risk for microalbuminuria (OR 0.22 and 0.31, respectively; 95% CI 0.09-0.56 and 0.13-0.76, respectively). When fish protein and fat were adjusted for each other, a high intake of fish protein but not of fish fat was still significantly associated with a decrease in the risk for microalbuminuria.",

Context: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A or VEGF) is a major pathogenic factor and therapeutic target for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Since VEGF has been proposed as a survival factor for retinal neurons, defining the cellular origin of pathogenic VEGF is necessary for the effectiveness and safety of long-term anti-VEGF therapies for DR. To determine the significance of Müller cell-derived VEGF in DR, we disrupted VEGF in Müller cells with an inducible Cre/lox system and examined diabetes-induced retinal inflammation and vascular leakage in these conditional VEGF knockout (KO) mice. Leukostasis was determined by counting the number of fluorescently labeled leukocytes inside retinal vasculature. Expression of biomarkers for retinal inflammation was assessed by immunoblotting of TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and NF-kappaB. Vascular leakage was measured by immunoblotting of retinal albumin and fluorescent microscopic analysis of extravascular albumin. Diabetes-induced vascular alterations were examined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry for tight junctions, and by trypsin digestion assays for acellular capillaries. Retinal integrity was analyzed with morphologic and morphometric analyses. Diabetic conditional VEGF KO mice exhibited significantly reduced leukostasis, expression of inflammatory biomarkers, depletion of tight junction proteins, numbers of acellular capillaries, and vascular leakage compared to diabetic control mice.",

Context: The recovery profile of train-of-four ratio to more than 0.70 in patients with diabetes mellitus has not been well investigated. Our primary objective was to evaluate the spontaneous recovery profile of neuromuscular block by vecuronium until train-of-four ratio more than 0.90 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with controls, using first dorsal interosseous electromyography. Single-centre prospective case-control study. The operating theatres of Fukuoka University Hospital. Fourteen adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (diabetes mellitus group) and 14 control patients (control group) were included in this study. Evoked responses to train-of-four stimuli were measured by electromyography at the first dorsal interosseous muscle. General anaesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl and remifentanil. Vecuronium (0.1  mg kg) was administered to all patients. Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol, fentanyl and remifentanil. The neuromuscular block was assessed until spontaneous recovery to train-of-four ratio more than 0.90. Recovery times to train-of-four ratio 0.70 and 0.90.

        "input": "Question: Is mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 an essential mediator of metabolic and mitogenic effects of fibroblast growth factor 19 in hepatoma cells? Context: Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is an important postprandial enterokine which regulates liver metabolism and hepatocyte proliferation. However, the precise mechanism by which FGF19 regulates these cellular effects is poorly understood. Given that mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates numerous postprandial adaptations, we investigated the potential role of mTORC1 in FGF19 action. We found that FGF19 activated mTORC1 in HepG2 and HuH7 human hepatoma cells, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and mouse liver. FGF19 activates the mTORC1-p70S6K and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)-p90RSK pathways independently to regulate S6 in an additive manner in hepatoma cells, but it uses mTORC1 as the primary pathway to regulate S6 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Thus, mTORC1 is a novel mediator of FGF19 signaling, which can act in parallel with Erk or function as the primary pathway to regulate S6. The FGF19-induced mTORC1 pathway requires amino acids for efficient signaling; thus, involvement of mTORC1 confers amino acid sensitivity to FGF19 signaling. Although Akt and Erk are known to activate mTORC1, we found that FGF19 signals to mTORC1 through a third recently identified mTORC1 regulator, Ras-like (Ral) protein. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of RalA or RalB abolished FGF19-induced mTORC1 activation, demonstrating that Ral proteins are required for FGF19 to activate mTORC1. FGF19 induced metabolic gene expression, fatty acid oxidation, cell growth, and proliferation in HepG2 cells; and these effects were abolished by mTORC1 inhibition, demonstrating an essential role of mTORC1 in FGF19 action.",

Context: Conflicting evidence exists as to whether focal cerebral ischemia contributes to cerebral amyloid deposition. We aimed to look at Aβ deposits, detected by N-methyl-2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (PiB) positron emission tomography, in patients with recent ischemic stroke. Specifically, we hypothesized that patients with recent ischemic stroke have higher local and neocortical PiB positron emission tomography retention and that this may be associated with major vascular risk factors. Ischemic stroke patients were studied using PiB positron emission tomography within 30 days and compared to age-matched controls. Distribution volume ratio maps were created using Logan graphical analysis with the cerebellar cortex as a reference. Among the 21 ischemic stroke patients (median age, 76 years; interquartile range, 68-77), the ipsilateral peri-infarct region PiB retention was higher compared to the contralateral mirror region, with a PiB distribution volume ratio difference of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.2-0.44; P=0.001) at median 10 (interquartile range, 7-14) days after stroke. Two patients also had higher PiB retention within the infarct compared to the contralateral side. There was no difference in the neocortical PiB retention elsewhere in the brain among ischemic stroke patients compared with 22 age-matched normal controls (P=0.22). Among the risk factors in the ischemic stroke patients, diabetes was associated with a higher neocortical PiB retention (Spearman Rho=0.48; 95% CI, 0.28-0.72).",

        "input": "Question: Is insulin sensitivity reflected by characteristic metabolic fingerprints -- a Fourier transform mass spectrometric non-targeted metabolomics approach? Context: A decline in body insulin sensitivity in apparently healthy individuals indicates a high risk to develop type 2 diabetes. Investigating the metabolic fingerprints of individuals with different whole body insulin sensitivity according to the formula of Matsuda, et al. (ISI(Matsuda)) by a non-targeted metabolomics approach we aimed a) to figure out an unsuspicious and altered metabolic pattern, b) to estimate a threshold related to these changes based on the ISI, and c) to identify the metabolic pathways responsible for the discrimination of the two patterns. By applying infusion ion cyclotron resonance Fourier transform mass spectrometry, we analyzed plasma of 46 non-diabetic subjects exhibiting high to low insulin sensitivities. The orthogonal partial least square model revealed a cluster of 28 individuals with alterations in their metabolic fingerprints associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity. This group could be separated from 18 subjects with an unsuspicious metabolite pattern. The orthogonal signal correction score scatter plot suggests a threshold of an ISI(Matsuda) of 15 for the discrimination of these two groups. Of note, a potential subgroup represented by eight individuals (ISI(Matsuda) value between 8.5 and 15) was identified in different models. This subgroup may indicate a metabolic transition state, since it is already located within the cluster of individuals with declined insulin sensitivity but the metabolic fingerprints still show some similarities with unaffected individuals (ISI >15). Moreover, the highest number of metabolite intensity differences between unsuspicious and altered metabolic fingerprints was detected in lipid metabolic pathways (arachidonic acid metabolism, metabolism of essential fatty acids and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids), steroid hormone biosyntheses and bile acid metabolism, based on data evaluation using the metabolic annotation interface MassTRIX.",

Context: Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) is an effective treatment for recalcitrant diabetic macular oedema (DMO). It has been shown to improve vision with benefits persisting up to five years. The most common initial side effect of IVTA treatment is rise in intraocular pressure, occurring in approximately 50% of patients within the first 6 months of treatment. We evaluated whether there is a correlation between the development of intraocular pressure rise and improvement in vision. Analysis of individual data from 33 eyes of 33 participants treated with IVTA for DMO from a prospective, randomised, double-masked, placebo controlled trial. The degree of intraocular pressure (IOP) rise was correlated with improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 1 and 6 months. The proportion of eyes gaining 5 or more logMAR letters was higher in eyes with greater IOP rise (p = 0.044). Better absolute improvement in BCVA at 6 months (p = 0.045) was also found in eyes with greater IOP rise. Regression analyses revealed a correlation between IOP rise of 10 or more mmHg and absolute BCVA improvement at 6 months (odds ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.48, p = 0.039), but not at 1 month.",

Context: A variant (rs1495741) in the gene for the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) protein is associated with skin intrinsic fluorescence (SIF), a noninvasive measure of advanced glycation end products and other fluorophores in the skin. Because NAT2 is involved in caffeine metabolism, we aimed to determine whether caffeine consumption is associated with SIF and whether rs1495741 is associated with SIF independently of caffeine. SIF was measured in 1,181 participants with type 1 diabetes from the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study. Two measures of SIF were used: SIF1, using a 375-nm excitation light-emitting diode (LED), and SIF14 (456-nm LED). Food frequency questionnaires were used to estimate mean caffeine intake. To establish replication, we examined a second type 1 diabetes cohort. Higher caffeine intake was significantly associated with higher SIF1(LED 375 nm[0.6, 0.2]) (P=2×10(-32)) and SIF14L(ED 456 nm[0.4, 0.8]) (P=7×10(-31)) and accounted for 4% of the variance in each after adjusting for covariates.

Context: Inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Bacteria such as Actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. It is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (LAB) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. Hence, the study was undertaken to screen LABs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. This study isolated, screened, identified and extracted Lactobacillus strains (Lb1-15) from human infant faecal samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. Lactobacillus reference strains (Ref1-7), a Gram positive control (Ctrl1) and two Gram negative controls (Ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. Faecal isolates were identified by DNA sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of Lactobacillus plantarum. Some strains (L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. casei and L. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). Inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (Bifidobacterium bifidum and Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium). Interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (L. plantarum) differed substantially. Some Lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and amylase). Anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a L. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (Area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg).",

Context: Adiponectin is an adipocytokine with antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. We investigated associations between circulating adiponectin, inflammation and cardiovascular disease in peritoneal dialysis patients. A prospective study was performed in 59 non-diabetic patients. The concentrations of serum adiponectin, biochemical data and ultrasound of carotid artery were measured at enrollment. The patients were followed up to 39 months mainly for cardiovascular events. The serum adiponectin concentration was elevated and inversely related to C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 in the patients. The adiponectin level of patients with carotid plaques was significantly lower than in those without plaques (p < 0.01). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the cumulative survival without new cardiovascular events was better in patients with higher adiponectin levels than in those with lower adiponectin levels.",

We evaluated the effect of HCV on risk of DM in relation to traditional risk factors such as age, body mass index (BMI) and family history of DM in an HIV-infected population. This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study of 1529 HIV-infected out-patients. An adjusted multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the effect of HCV seropositivity on DM stratified by low and high propensity for DM based on age, BMI and family history. Race, age, BMI, family history and HCV were associated with DM. Use of protease inhibitors (PIs) was not associated with DM, but HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were less likely to be on PIs than those with HIV infection alone. In a multivariate analysis controlled for race, the association between HCV and DM was stronger in lean, young patients without a family history of DM; the low-risk group. No association between HCV and type 2 DM was seen in patients who were older or overweight or had a family history of DM; the high-risk group.

Context: An increasing amount of evidence indicates that mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays a role in the development of diabetic nephropathy. The main objective of the study was to analyse whether MBL influences the effects of diabetes on the kidneys. In one group of wild-type mice and in one group of MBL double knockout mice we induced diabetes by the use of streptozotocin as a model of type 1 diabetes. Two groups of non-diabetic mice, wild-type and MBL knockout, were also included. By two-way ANOVA we evaluated if MBL modulated the effects of diabetes by testing the interaction between diabetes and MBL. MBL interacted with the effects of diabetes on three outcome measures: kidney weight (p < 0.001), urinary albumin excretion (p = 0.001) and the expression of collagen IV alpha 1 (Col4a1) mRNA (p = 0.002). This means that the effects that diabetes normally has on these parameters were significantly modified by MBL. MBL showed a tendency to interact with the effects of diabetes on glomerular basement membrane thickness and total mesangial volume (p = 0.065 and p = 0.063, respectively). Glomerular volume and total mesangial volume were significantly smaller in animals lacking MBL than in wild-type animals (p = 0.006 and p = 0.047, respectively).",

Context: T2 mapping indicates to be a sensitive method for detection of tissue oedema hidden beyond the detection limits of T2-weighted Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR). However, due to variability of baseline T2 values in volunteers, reference values need to be defined. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the effects of age and sex on quantitative T2 mapping with a turbo gradient-spin-echo (GRASE) sequence at 1.5 T. For that reason, we studied sensitivity issues as well as technical and biological effects on GRASE-derived myocardial T2 maps. Furthermore, intra- and interobserver variability were calculated using data from a large volunteer group. GRASE-derived multiecho images were analysed using dedicated software. After sequence optimization, validation and sensitivity measurements were performed in muscle phantoms ex vivo and in vivo. The optimized parameters were used to analyse CMR images of 74 volunteers of mixed sex and a wide range of age with typical prevalence of hypertension and diabetes. Myocardial T2 values were analysed globally and according to the 17 segment model. Strain-encoded (SENC) imaging was additionally performed to investigate possible effects of myocardial strain on global or segmental T2 values. Ex vivo studies in muscle phantoms showed, that GRASE-derived T2 values were comparable to those acquired by a standard multiecho spinecho sequence but faster by a factor of 6. Besides that, T2 values reflected tissue water content. The in vivo measurements in volunteers revealed intra- and interobserver correlations with R2=0.91 and R2=0.94 as well as a coefficients of variation of 2.4% and 2.2%, respectively. While global T2 time significantly decreased towards the heart basis, female volunteers had significant higher T2 time irrespective of myocardial region. We found no correlation of segmental T2 values with maximal systolic, diastolic strain or heart rate. Interestingly, volunteers´ age was significantly correlated to T2 time while that was not the case for other coincident cardiovascular risk factors.",

Real-time PCR was used to measure decorin gene expression in adipose tissue from normal glucose tolerant (NGT), impaired glucose tolerant and type 2 diabetic (T2D) Psammomys obesus. Adipose tissue was fractionated to determine which cells were responsible for decorin expression. The location of decorin protein expression in adipose tissue was determined using immunohistochemistry. Real-time PCR was used to measure decorin mRNA levels in human adipose tissue from 16 insulin-sensitive, 16 insulin-resistant and 6 T2D human subjects. Circulating plasma decorin concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 145 NGT and 141 T2D human individuals from a large-scale epidemiological study in Mauritius. Decorin mRNA was found to be highly expressed in adipose tissue, and decorin gene expression was significantly higher in visceral than that in subcutaneous adipose tissue depots in both P. obesus and human subjects (P=0.002 and P=0.001, respectively). Decorin mRNA was predominantly expressed by stromal/vascular cells of adipose tissue, and decorin protein in adipose tissue was primarily detected adjacent to blood vessels. Circulating plasma decorin levels in humans were elevated by 12% in T2D (P=0.049) compared to NGT subjects. There was a significant independent correlation between plasma decorin levels and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, P=0.024).

Among 4,501 subjects from the French Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR) cohort, 1,277 subjects (644 men and 633 women) were randomly selected for the analysis of iron biomarkers at baseline and at 3 years. In addition, to determine whether these parameters were relevant to pathological changes, all 231 subjects normoglycemic at baseline and hyperglycemic 3 years later were analyzed for iron biomarkers. At baseline, plasma ferritin concentrations were positively correlated with fasting insulin and fasting glucose in the 1,277 subjects. Although transferrin and ferritin were negatively correlated, transferrin was also positively correlated with fasting insulinemia. Baseline ferritin concentration was an independent predictor of an increase in insulin concentration over a 3-year period (P = 0.002).

Context: To determine whether there is a relationship between 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), a marker of postprandial hyperglycaemia and glycaemic variability, and the presence of diabetic retinopathy and albuminuria in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Five hundred and sixty-seven patients with Type 2 diabetes (serum creatinine < 133 μmol/l), who were enrolled in the Seoul Metro-City Diabetes Prevention Program (SMC-DPP), were cross-sectionally assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. After controlling for age, sex, binary HbA(1c) levels, duration of diabetes, triglyceride, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker medication, the odds ratios (95% CI) of diabetic retinopathy were 2.86 (1.12-7.25) for the first (lowest) quartile of 1,5-anhydroglucitol, 2.87 (1.25-6.61) for the second quartile and 0.88 (0.35-2.22) for the third quartile compared with the fourth quartile (P for trend = 0.010). Conversely, the associations between 1,5-anhydroglucitol and clinical albuminuria were non-significant after adjustment.

Context: Advanced glycation end products (AGE) and a receptor for AGE (RAGE) play a key role in diabetic vascular complications. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and apoptosis contribute to plaque instability. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is crucial for NADPH oxidase-dependent redox signaling pathways in the vascular wall. We investigated the effects of RAS blockade on AGE-triggered signaling pathways and its downstream events, including MMP-9 and apoptosis. We used cultured rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which were stimulated with AGE in the presence or absence of temocaprilat or olmesartan. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA levels were increased 4 to 6 hours after adding AGE. AGE induced Rac1 and p47(phox) membrane translocation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and NF-kappaB phosphorylation within 15 minutes, and various molecular expressions after 18 hours, which were attenuated by RAS blockade by temocaprilat or olmesartan. AGE-induced RAGE expression, as well as other molecules, including membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), was NADPH oxidase signaling-dependent and blunted by temocaprilat and olmesartan. The parameters of plaque instability, including MMP-9 expression and activity, and apoptosis were up-regulated by AGE, which was markedly attenuated by temocaprilat or olmesartan. Using isolated human monocyte culture, AGE-induced ROS generation and molecular expression were also attenuated by RAS blockade.",

Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats were divided into two groups, ad lib (n = 4), and RYGB (n = 6). Bile acid and L-PGDS were measured presurgery and fourteen weeks post-surgery. Elevation of bile acid levels following RYGB in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rodents was observed, as compared to ad lib. RYGB in ZDF rodents led to a significantly decreased aortic wall thickness (25%) as compared to ad lib control. Although bile acid metabolism is implicated in these alterations, other mediators are likely involved. Our laboratory has demonstrated lipocalin prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS) is a kno n cardiometabolic modulator that also functions as a bile acid binding protein.

Context: Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased extracellular volume. Sodium restriction might seem a logical form of treatment but data on its renal effects is conflicting. We therefore studied the effects of sodium restriction on renal haemodynamics in uncomplicated Type I diabetes mellitus. Uncomplicated Type I diabetic patients ( n = 24) and matched control subjects ( n = 24) were studied twice in random order: after a week of 50 mmol or after 200 mmol sodium intake, respectively. The diabetic patients were studied under normoglycaemic clamp conditions. Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were measured as the clearances of iothalamate and hippuran, respectively. During liberal sodium intake, glomerular filtration, effective renal plasma flow and filtration fraction were similar between the diabetic patients and the control subjects. Sodium restriction decreased the effective renal plasma flow in both groups, whereas glomerular filtration rate only decreased in the control subjects. Consequently, in the diabetic patients, the filtration fraction was increased on low sodium (4.1 +/- 8.4 %, p < 0.05 vs liberal sodium). As a consequence, filtration fraction (24.0 +/- 2.6 vs 22.1 +/- 2.0 %, p < 0.05) and glomerular filtration (119 +/- 14 vs 110 +/- 13 ml/min, p < 0.05) were higher in the diabetic patients than in the control subjects during sodium restriction.",

This study evaluates new specific small-molecule inhibitors of 12-lipoxygenase for protecting rodent and human beta cells from inflammatory damage. Mouse beta cell lines and mouse and human islets were treated with inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNFα and IFNγ in the absence or presence of novel selective 12-lipoxygenase inhibitors. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), gene expression, cell survival and 12-S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-S-HETE) levels were evaluated using established methods. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with the lead inhibitor in CD1 mice. Inflammatory cytokines led to the loss of human beta cell function, elevated cell death, increased inflammatory gene expression and upregulation of 12-lipoxygenase expression and activity (measured by 12-S-HETE generation). Two 12-lipoxygenase inhibitors, Compounds 5 and 9, produced a concentration-dependent reduction of stimulated 12-S-HETE levels. GSIS was preserved in the presence of the 12-lipoxygenase inhibitors. 12-Lipoxygenase inhibition preserved survival of primary mouse and human islets.

Context: Shared dysregulated pathways may contribute to Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes, chronic diseases that afflict millions of people worldwide. Despite the evidence provided by epidemiological and gene profiling studies, the molecular and functional networks implicated in both diseases, have not been fully explored. In this study, we used an integrated network approach to investigate the extent to which Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes are linked at the molecular level. Using a random walk algorithm within the human functional linkage network we identified a molecular cluster of 478 neighboring genes closely associated with confirmed Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes genes. Biological and functional analysis identified the protein serine-threonine kinase activity, MAPK cascade, activation of the immune response, and insulin receptor and lipid signaling as convergent pathways. Integration of results from microarrays studies identified a blood signature comprising seven genes whose expression is dysregulated in Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes. Among this group of genes, is the amyloid precursor protein (APP), previously associated with neurodegeneration and insulin regulation. Quantification of RNA from whole blood of 192 samples from two independent clinical trials, the Harvard Biomarker Study (HBS) and the Prognostic Biomarker Study (PROBE), revealed that expression of APP is significantly upregulated in Parkinson's disease patients compared to healthy controls.

Context: Online patient portals are being widely implemented, but their impact on health behaviors are not well-studied. To determine whether statin adherence improved after initiating use of the portal refill function. Observational cohort study within an integrated health care delivery system. Diabetic patients on statins who had registered for online portal access by 2010. A total of 8705 subjects initiated the online refill function use within the study window, including \"exclusive\" and \"occasional\" users (ie, requesting all vs. some refills online, respectively). Using risk-set sampling, we temporally matched 9055 reference group patients who never used online refills. We calculated statin adherence before and after refill function initiation, assessed as percent time without medications (nonadherence defined as a gap of >20%). Secondary outcome was dyslipidemia [low-density lipoprotein (LDL)≥ 100]. Difference-in-differences regression models estimated pre-post changes in nonadherence and dyslipidemia, comparing refill function users to the reference group and adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, medications, frequency of portal use, and outpatient visits. In unadjusted examinations, nonadherence decreased only among patients initiating occasional or exclusive use of the refill function (26%-24% and 22%-15%, respectively). In adjusted models, nonadherence declined by an absolute 6% (95% confidence interval, 4%-7%) among exclusive users, without significant changes among occasional users. Similar LDL decreases were also seen among exclusive users.",

Context: APPL1 (adaptor protein containing PH domain, PTB domain and leucine zipper motif 1) is the first identified cytosolic protein that directly binds to adiponectin receptors and mediates cellular responses to adiponectin. We set out to determine whether genetic variation within the APPL locus (encoding APPL1) contributes to insulin resistance, changes in lipid metabolism or inflammatory parameters in a healthy White population. We genotyped 640 healthy subjects with and without a family history of diabetes for the four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs6774584, rs3087684, rs17791685 and rs528035 and performed correlational analyses with metabolic and inflammatory traits. SNPs rs6774584, rs3087684, rs17791685 and rs528035 are representative of the four blocks of high linkage disequilibrium covering a 78-kb genomic locus that harbours the APPL gene. None of these SNPs correlated with anthropometric data (gender, age, body mass index, body fat, waist-hip ratio) or with family history of diabetes. Furthermore, no correlations were found with parameters of insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. None of the SNPs was correlated with ectopic lipid content or with plasma lipids (non-esterified fatty acids, glycerol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol). Moreover, no correlations were detected with leucocyte measures or plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, interleukin 6 or tumour necrosis factor-alpha.

Context: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an acknowledged risk factor for atherosclerosis, and diabetics are more likely to have hypertension. Atherosclerosis and hypertension are risk factors for aortic dissection. However, recent studies have shown that DM is associated with changes in aortic wall collagen. In this retrospective study we assess the relationship between DM and thoracic aortic dissection (TAD). Patients with a diagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection during the last 10 years were identified from our hospital records. The prevalence of DM in Stanford type A and B TAD was compared with that of two age- and gender-matched control groups. For every diabetic dissection case, 10 controls were selected from the hospital data. Two hundred nineteen patients (median age 61 years, male:female ratio 145:74) were identified with TAD, comprising 131 type A dissections and 88 type B dissections. Only 3 of 131 (2.3%) type A aortic dissections were diabetics, whereas, in control group 1, 241 of 1310 (18.4%) were diabetics and, in control group 2, 116 of 1310 (8.9%) were diabetics [odds ratios: 0.1 (0.03-0.32) and 0.24 (0.07-0.76), respectively] (P = 0.0001 and 0.007, respectively).

Context: E-52862 (S1RA, 4-[2-[[5-methyl-1-(2-naphthalenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]oxy]ethyl]-morpholine), a novel selective sigma 1 receptor (σ1R) antagonist, has demonstrated efficacy in nociceptive and neuropathic pain models. Our aim was to test if σ1R blockade with E-52862 may modify the signs of neuropathy in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, a type 2 diabetes model. Mechanical and thermal response thresholds were tested on 7-, 13-, 14- and 15-week-old ZDF rats treated with saline or with E-52862 acutely administered on week 13, followed by sub-chronic administration (14 days). Axonal peripheral activity (skin-saphenous nerve preparation) and isolated aorta or mesenteric bed reactivity were analysed in 15-week-old ZDF rats treated with saline or E-52862 and in LEAN rats. Zucker diabetic fatty rats showed significantly decreased thermal withdrawal latency and threshold to mechanical stimulation on week 13 compared to week 7 (prediabetes) and with LEAN animals; single-dose and sub-chronic E-52862 administration restored both parameters to those recorded on week 7. Regarding axonal peripheral activity, E-52862 treatment increased the mean mechanical threshold (77.3 ± 21 mN vs. 19.6 ± 1.5 mN, saline group) and reduced the response evoked by mechanical increasing stimulation (86.4 ± 36.5 vs. 352.8 ± 41.4 spikes) or by repeated mechanical supra-threshold steps (39.4 ± 1.4 vs. 83.5 ± 0.9).

Context: Osteoclasts (OCs) are multinucleated giant cells that resorb bone matrix. Accelerated bone destruction by OCs might cause several metabolic bone-related diseases, such as osteoporosis and inflammatory bone loss. D-pinitol (3-O-methyl-D-chiro-inositol) is a prominent component of dietary legumes and is actively converted to D-chiro-inositol, which is a putative insulin-like mediator. In this study, we analyzed the effect of D-chiro-inositol on OC differentiation. To analyze the role of D-chiro-inositol on OC differentiation, we examined OC differentiation by the three types of osteoclastogenesis cultures with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and solution assay. Then, we carried out cell fusion assay with purified TRAP(+) mononuclear OC precursors. Finally, we analyzed the effect of D-chiro-inositol on OC maker expression in response to the regulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). We demonstrated that D-chiro-inositol acts as an inhibitor of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-induced OC differentiation. The formation of multinucleated OCs by cell-cell fusion is reduced by treatment with D-chiro-inositol in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we demonstrated that D-chiro-inositol inhibits the expression of several osteoclastogenic genes by down-regulating NFATc1.",

The R1467H variant of ARHGEF11 has been reported to be associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Western populations. We investigated the effects of the R1467H variant on susceptibility to T2DM as well as related traits in a Korean population. We genotyped the R1467H (rs945508) of ARHGEF11 in 689 unrelated T2DM patients and 249 non-diabetic individuals and compared the clinical and biochemical characteristics according to different alleles. The H allele was significantly more frequent in T2DM cases than in controls (P = 0.037, 17.1% and 13.1%; respectively).

Context: Osteoporosis and diabetes are physiologic determinants that affect the process of osseointegration. The demand for dental implants is high in these patients, who have benefited from progress in preclinical research. Osseointegration has been extensively studied in rat models of osteoporosis and diabetes. The aim of this study is to present an assessment of the published data and provide consideration for future studies. The present study summarizes information through a systematic review of the literature from 1997 to 2008 available through PUBMED. The authors found 20 and 13 articles that report on osseointegration of implants in osteoporotic and diabetic rats, respectively. The survey was extended to recent publications on relevant aspects related to species, strains, and quality of endpoint data. Differences in experimental variables such as timing of implant insertion, location of implants, or duration of disease prior to implant placement were reported and can be justified based on the experimental questions. Moreover, heterogeneity was further caused by variations in the age of rats and in reporting of the main parameters of osseointegration in the cortical and medullary compartments. Regardless of these differences, the evidence indicates consistently that ovariectomy results in reduced osseointegration, while there is only moderate evidence for impaired osseointegration in diabetic rats.",

Context: Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is a chronic stomach infection common throughout the world. The pediatric diabetes literature on the relation between Hp and HbA1c is sparse and controversial. This study aimed to investigate this relation. The study included 100 youth with type 1 diabetes and seropositive for Hp (European Caucasians: n=49; Moghrabin Caucasians: n=51). Mean socioeconomic status was lower among the latter. Hp infection was demonstrated by the (13)C-urea breath test and a gastric biopsy for antibiotic susceptibility testing. HbA1c levels were measured for a year (mean: 6 measurements; upper normal limit: 6.2%) before and after Hp eradication, which was proved by the (13)C-urea breath test. Of 100 Hp-seropositive patients, 49 had active Hp infections and were treated. Mean age+/-SD was 14.2+/-2.8 years, and duration of diabetes at Hp diagnosis was 6.2 +/-2.3 years. Hp infection was eradicated in 38/49 subjects (78%). Eleven (22%) remained infected and required a second treatment. The two subgroups did not differ for age, duration of diabetes or pretreatment HbA1c levels (7.3+/-1.5% versus 7.8+/-0.8%; p=0.16).

Thirty Lewis rats weighing approximately 250 g were made diabetic by tail vein injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Laparotomy was performed through a midline incision under ether anesthesia. A colonic segment 5 cm distal to the ileocecal junction was transected then anastomosed with absorbable suture. Anastomotic strength was measured on days 3, 5, 7 and 14 postoperatively, and compared with normal rats. Collagen type I and type III mRNA together with the total collagen concentration were measured in anastomotic sites. Anastomotic strength in diabetic rats was significantly lower on day 7, but gradually recovered up to day 14.

Context: Human exposures to inorganic arsenic (iAs) have been linked to an increased risk of diabetes mellitus. Recent laboratory studies showed that methylated trivalent metabolites of iAs may play key roles in the diabetogenic effects of iAs. Our study examined associations between chronic exposure to iAs in drinking water, metabolism of iAs, and prevalence of diabetes in arsenicosis-endemic areas of Mexico. We used fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) to characterize diabetic individuals. Arsenic levels in drinking water and urine were determined to estimate exposure to iAs. Urinary concentrations of iAs and its trivalent and pentavalent methylated metabolites were measured to assess iAs metabolism. Associations between diabetes and iAs exposure or urinary metabolites of iAs were estimated by logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, hypertension and obesity. The prevalence of diabetes was positively associated with iAs in drinking water (OR 1.13 per 10 ppb, p < 0.01) and with the concentration of dimethylarsinite (DMAsIII) in urine (OR 1.24 per inter-quartile range, p = 0.05). Notably, FPI and HOMA-IR were negatively associated with iAs exposure (β -2.08 and -1.64, respectively, p < 0.01), suggesting that the mechanisms of iAs-induced diabetes differ from those underlying type-2 diabetes, which is typically characterized by insulin resistance.",

Context: Transcription factor E3 (TFE3) has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity by activating insulin-signalling pathways. However, the role of TFE3 in glucose homeostasis is not fully understood. Here, we explored the possible therapeutic potential of TFE3 for the control of hyperglycaemia using a streptozotocin-induced mouse model of diabetes. We achieved overabundance of TFE3 in streptozotocin mice by administering an adenovirus (Ad) or adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2). We also performed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT). To explore molecular mechanisms of blood glucose control by TFE3, transcriptional studies on the regulation of genes involved in hepatic glucose metabolism were performed using quantitative real-time PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The binding site of TFE3 in the liver Gck gene promoter was identified using deletion and site-specific mutation studies. Overabundance of TFE3 resulted in reduced hyperglycaemia as shown by the OGTT and ITT in streptozotocin-treated mice. We observed that TFE3 can upregulate Gck in a state of insulin deficiency. However, glucose-6-phosphatase and cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA levels were decreased by Ad-mediated overexpression of Tcfe3. Biochemical studies revealed that the anti-hyperglycaemic effect of TFE3 is due to the upregulation of Gck. In primary cultured hepatocytes, TFE3 increased expression of Gck mRNA. Conversely, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of TFE3 resulted in a decrease in Gck mRNA.",

Context: To compare a simple meal plan emphasizing healthy food choices with a traditional exchange-based meal plan in reducing HbA(1c) levels in urban African Americans with type 2 diabetes. A total of 648 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive instruction in either a healthy food choices meal plan (HFC) or an exchange-based meal plan (EXCH) to compare the impact on glycemic control, weight loss, serum lipids, and blood pressure at 6 months of follow-up. Dietary practices were assessed with food frequency questionnaires. At presentation, the HFC and EXCH groups were comparable in age (52 years), sex (65% women), weight (94 kg), BMI (33.5), duration of diabetes (4.8 years), fasting plasma glucose (10.5 mmol/l), and HbA(1c) (9.4%). Improvements in glycemic control over 6 months were significant (P < 0.0001) but similar in both groups: HbA(1c) decreased from 9.7 to 7.8% with the HFC and from 9.6 to 7.7% with the EXCH. Improvements in HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were comparable in both groups, whereas other lipids and blood pressure were not altered. The HFC and EXCH groups exhibited similar improvement in dietary practices with respect to intake of fats and sugar sweetened foods.

Context: Recently a relationship between circadian clock function and the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been shown. BMAL1 is a key component of the mammalian molecular clock. Two SNPs in the BMAL1 gene have been identified to confer T2D susceptibility. In the present study we investigated for the first time the association between the BMAL1 gene and the risk for GDM, in a Greek population. We studied 185 women with GDM and 161 non-diabetic controls for BMAL1 polymorphisms. For BMAL1 mRNA expression, peripheral leukocytes were harvested from 20 GDM and 20 control women, harboring different genotypes for the tested polymorphisms, using real-time quantitative PCR. The minor allele (A) of the BMAL1 rs7950226 (G>A) polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM (P=0.025). Analysis of the second BMAL1 rs11022775 (T>C) polymorphism, showed that the C-allele frequency was strongly increased in women with GDM (P=4.455e-06). The CC genotype was also significantly overrepresented in GDM vs. controls (P=0.00001). Additionally, the rs7950226G/rs11022775C and rs7950226A/rs11022775C haplotypes were also found to be associated with increased susceptibility to GDM.

Context: Because increased expression of protein tyrosine phosphatases in the pancreatic islets may contribute to impaired insulin secretion in diabetes, we studied the effects of the phosphatase inhibitor peroxovanadate (pV) in islets of spontaneously diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) and control Wistar rats. Insulin release and glucose use were studied in isolated islets of GK and control rats. Insulin release from isolated GK rat islets at 3.3 and 16.7 mmol/L glucose was enhanced by pV in a dose-dependent manner (0.1-1 mmol/L). This was partly in contrast to the effect of pV in Wistar rat islets, where insulin response to 16.7 mmol/L glucose was inhibited by 0.01-0.1 mmol/L of the compound. In GK rat islets, pV was a strong initiator of insulin release and also had some potentiating effect on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas in Wistar rat islets, pV only had an initiating, and lacked potentiating, effect. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin suppressed pV-induced insulin release at 3.3 mmol/L but not at 16.7 mmol/L glucose in both GK and Wistar rat islets. The modulatory effects by pV on insulin release were not related to effects by the compound on islet glucose metabolism.",

The aim of this study was to investigate for the first time the antiangiogenic effects of amygdalin on the cultured endothelial cells of diabetic rats. A total of 20 streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were divided into two equal groups of control and amygdalin-treated animals. Eight weeks after the induction of diabetes, amygdalin was injected intraperitoneally (3 mg/kg) to the rats of the treatment group. One day later, rats were sacrificed; the aortic arteries were excised and cut as 2 mm rings. Each aortic ring was incubated in a cell-culture well for 7 days. The process of angiogenesis was monitored by counting the number of microvessels and primary microtubules in each well. Optic microscopy showed proliferation and migration of new endothelial cells to the fibrin gels. The endothelial cells produced primary microtubules which gradually made several branches and finally made a vascular matrix. The number of the primary microtubules and microvessels were significantly lower in the amygdalin-treated vs. control group (P < 0.01).",

Context: This study investigated the effect of low-intensity laser irradiation (LILI) on pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in wound healing processes in diabetes and hypoxia. Diabetes is associated with impaired wound healing and a prolonged inflammatory phase. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 are elevated in diabetes. LILI has been reported to accelerate wound healing and decrease inflammatory cytokines. A human skin fibroblast cell line (WS1) was used in vitro. Cells were exposed to various insults, namely, wounding, and a diabetic or hypoxic environment. Experimental cells were exposed to an energy density of 5  J/cm(2) using a continuous wave 636-nm diode laser at an average power of 95  mW, an illuminated area of 9.05  cm(2), and an irradiance of 11 mW/cm(2) (irradiation time, 476  sec). The effect of laser irradiation on cytokine expression was examined at 1 or 24  h post-irradiation. Cellular morphology, viability, proliferation, and cytokine expression (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) were investigated. Translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) was also determined. There was a higher rate of migration in irradiated wounded cultures, and irradiated hypoxic cells showed an improvement in cellular morphology. All cell models showed an increase in proliferation. Normal wounded cells showed a decrease in apoptosis, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Diabetic wounded cells showed an increase in viability and a decrease in apoptosis and IL-1β, whereas hypoxic cells showed an increase in viability and IL-6, and a decrease in apoptosis and TNF-α.

Context: Mg deficiency may be an important factor leading to cardiovascular disease. Diabetic subjects show an increase in platelet reactivity that can enhance the risks of vascular disease. In addition, diabetic patients have been reported to be at risk of developing extracellular Mg deficiency. However, the intracellular free Mg concentration and its role in the enhanced platelet reactivity in diabetes is not known. We evaluated the intracellular erythrocyte (RBC) Mg2+ concentration in 20 non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetics. In addition, the effects of intravenous 3-h drip or 8 wk of oral Mg supplementation on intracellular RBC Mg2+ levels and platelet reactivity was studied. To more clearly evaluate the direct role of Mg in these effects, we induced isolated Mg deficiency in 16 nondiabetic control subjects with an Mg-free liquid diet for 3 wk. The intracellular RBC Mg2+ concentration of diabetic patients was significantly reduced compared with values in nondiabetic control subjects (166 +/- 7 vs. 204 +/- 7 microM, P less than 0.01). Serum Mg levels were also reduced in the diabetic patients compared with the control subjects (1.59 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.1 mEq/L, P less than 0.05). Oral Mg supplementation for 8 wk (400 mg/day) restored RBC Mg2+ concentration to normal without significantly changing serum Mg concentration. Both intravenous and oral Mg supplementation markedly reduced platelet reactivity in response to the thromboxane A2 analog, U46619.

PLTP is a plasma protein that mediates the net transfer and exchange of phospholipids between lipoproteins. It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and elevated plasma levels have been reported in patients with diabetes mellitus. Baseline plasma PLTP levels were measured in 154 male patients with diabetes mellitus who were referred for coronary angiography and followed prospectively for 5 years for the development of all-cause mortality.

SIH has been shown to result in worse outcomes after trauma. The presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) or occult DM within the cohort confounded previous studies. We identified 2 distinct populations of trauma patients with SIH or DH to determine the impact of hyperglycemia on these 2 groups. Admission glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), glucose levels, and comorbidity data were collected over a 2-year period. DM was determined by patient history or admission HbA1c 6.5% or more. SIH was determined by absence of DM and admission glucose 200 mg/dL or more. Cox proportional hazards models [adjusted for age, sex, injury mechanism, and injury severity score] were used to calculate risk ratios (RRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for outcomes of interest. During the study period, 6852 trauma patients were evaluated, and 5117 had available glucose, HbA1c, and comorbidity data. Patients with SIH had an over twofold increase in mortality risk (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.81-3.23), and patients with DH had a nonsignificant, near-50% increase in mortality risk (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.92-2.36).

Context: The activity of protein kinase C (PKC), preferentially beta isoform of PKC, has been shown to be elevated in the diabetic retina. Recently, LY333531, a specific inhibitor of PKC-beta, has been reported to improve the decrease of retinal blood flow in early diabetes. Increased leukocyte entrapment has been suggested to be involved in blood flow disturbances in the early diabetic retina. This study was designed quantitatively to evaluate leukocyte entrapment in the retinal microcirculation of diabetic rats and the effect of LY333531 on leukocyte entrapment. Diabetes was induced in male Long-Evans rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). LY333531 (0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 mg/kg/d) was administered orally during a 4-week diabetic period. Leukocyte entrapment in the retinal microcirculation was quantitatively evaluated in vivo with acridine orange digital fluorography. The number of leukocytes trapped in the retinal microcirculation of diabetic rats (mean +/- SEM; 14.3 +/- 1.3 cells/mm2) was significantly increased, compared with nondiabetic control rats (7.5 +/- 0.3 cells/mm2; P < 0.0001). Oral administration of LY333531 significantly decreased the number of leukocytes trapped in the retinal microcirculation of diabetic rats (10.9 +/- 0.6, 11.3 +/- 0.7, and 10.4 +/- 0.4 cells/mm2 with LY333531 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mg/kg/d, respectively; P < 0.05).",

Context: The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) was designed as a prospective intervention trial comparing the effect of a treatment based on the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril with that of a conventional diuretic and/or beta-blocker-based therapy, in 10,985 hypertensive patients. There was no difference in the primary cardiovascular morbidity and mortality endpoint. A lower incidence of diabetes mellitus during captopril treatment was observed in the whole CAPPP cohort that was non-diabetic at baseline (n = 10,413) as well as in such CAPPP patients that were previously untreated (n = 5033). A multivariate analysis of variables associated with the risk of developing diabetes in CAPPP demonstrated that glucose, body mass index (BMI), haemoglobin (Hb), age, 'SBP x Untreated' (the interaction between systolic blood pressure at baseline and newly diagnosed hypertension), cholesterol and prior antihypertensive treatment came out as risk factors. Based on these factors, a risk score for development of diabetes was calculated for all non-diabetic patients, who were divided into tertiles. For each tertile of risk, captopril therapy was associated with a reduced risk of diabetes development compared with conventional diuretic and/or beta-blocker therapy. When the non-diabetic cohort was divided into two subcohorts; previously treated and previously untreated patients, it turned out that the risk factors for developing diabetes differed between these two subcohorts. Only glucose, BMI and Hb came out as risk factors in all analysed cohorts.",

Context: Periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are major health problems, especially in low-income populations with little access to dental care. Low-cost models for treatment of periodontal disease have not been tested in controlled studies in low-income populations. Dental prophylaxis, which includes removal of supragingival calculus and plaque, has been shown to arrest the progression of periodontitis. A controlled clinical trial was conducted to determine the effect of dental prophylaxis on periodontitis in T2DM. Twenty-six patients with T2DM and chronic periodontitis (CP) and 26 without T2DM with CP were selected. Periodontal probing depth (PD), gingival bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment level (CAL), and surfaces with plaque were recorded at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months after initial treatment. All the participants received instructions on oral hygiene and one session of dental prophylaxis at baseline and every 3 months. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured at baseline and every 3 months in patients with T2DM. A significant improvement of PD, BOP, and sites with plaque was observed 3 months after treatment in patients with T2DM (P = 0.001). In controls, mean PD significantly improved after 6 months compared with baseline (P = 0.001). No significant improvement of CAL occurred in either group. No significant differences in periodontal parameters between the groups were detected, and no participant showed progression of CP during the 9-month study period. Dental prophylaxis did not influence HbA1c levels, and no association among HbA1c concentration, pretreatment metabolic status, and severity of CP was found.",

Context: Some aspects of memory performance are impaired during acute hypoglycaemia. The hippocampus is critical to formation of long-term memory, and may be particularly sensitive to hypoglycaemia. This study examined whether moderate hypoglycaemia occurring after learning would disrupt the consolidation process, and used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify accompanying changes in brain activation. Sixteen non-diabetic subjects each underwent two glucose clamp studies. During euglycaemia (4.5 mmol/L), subjects tried to memorize a series of words and a series of pictures of faces. Then, either hypoglycaemia (2.5 mmol/L) was induced for one hour, or euglycaemia was maintained. During subsequent uncontrolled euglycaemia, subjects' recognition of the word and face stimuli was tested, with simultaneous fMRI to measure brain activation during recognition. Face identification scores were 67.2% after euglycaemia and 66.9% after hypoglycaemia (p = 0.895). Word identification scores were 78.0 and 77.1% respectively (p = 0.701). Analysis of the fMRI identified two foci where activation was altered after hypoglycaemia compared with euglycaemia, but these were not in regions associated with memory, and were probably statistical artefacts.",

Data from 1394 patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy were obtained from a diabetes registry in Japan. We used the Diabetes Therapy-Related QOL (DTR-QOL) questionnaire and relative risk regression analysis to assess the independent association of high levels of self-care activities in insulin injection and DTR-QOL scores while adjusting for possible confounders.

Insulin stimulates production of NO by activating a signaling pathway including insulin receptor substrate-1, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). Angiotensin II type I (AT1) receptor-evoked oxidative stress is implicated in the inactivation of NO, impairing endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Blocking the actions of Angiotensin II with an AT1 receptor antagonist (Losartan), has beneficial effects in patients with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study investigated whether elevated Angiotensin II influences myocardial insulin resistance, insulin signaling and NO production in a rat model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) by antagonizing the actions of the AT1 receptor with Losartan. Isolated, perfused hearts, Western blotting and flow-cytometric methods were utilized to determine myocardial function, expression and phosphorylation of key proteins and NO production, respectively. Results showed that hearts from DIO rats are insulin resistant (higher serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, lower insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and eNOS, lower NO production) and had poorer functional recovery and larger infarct development after ischaemia/reperfusion. Losartan improved the impaired functional recovery, and NO production and enhanced eNOS expression and phosphorylation and reduced infarct size in hearts from the DIO animals. Data obtained from Losartan treatment also revealed that Angiotensin II signaling modulates myocardial PKB/Akt expression.",

The aim of this study was to identify segments of energy metabolism with normal or with altered function in human type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔψM), and its response to glucose, is the main driver of mitochondrial ATP synthesis and is hence a central mediator of glucose-induced insulin secretion, but its quantitative determination in β-cells from human donors has not been attempted, due to limitations in assay technology. Here, novel fluorescence microscopic assays are exploited to quantify ΔψM and its response to glucose and other secretagogues in β-cells of dispersed pancreatic islet cells from 4 normal and 3 type 2 diabetic organ donors. Mitochondrial volume densities and the magnitude of ΔψM in low glucose were not consistently altered in diabetic β-cells. However, ΔψM was consistently less responsive to elevation of glucose concentration, whereas the decreased response was not observed with metabolizable secretagogue mixtures that feed directly into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Single-cell analysis of the heterogeneous responses to metabolizable secretagogues indicated no dysfunction in relaying ΔψM hyperpolarization to plasma membrane potential depolarization in diabetic β-cells. ΔψM of diabetic β-cells was distinctly responsive to acute inhibition of ATP synthesis during glucose stimulation.",

Mesangial cell exposure to mechanical stretch induces both intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression. CC Chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), the cognate MCP-1 receptor, has been recently demonstrated in human mesangial cells (HMCs). We tested whether MCP-1 binding to CCR2 affects ICAM-1 expression in HMCs and, secondly, if stretch-induced ICAM-1 is mediated by MCP-1 via an autocrine mechanism. Serum-deprived HMCs were exposed to either rh-MCP-1 (0.1-1-10-50-100 ng/ml) or mechanical stretch in the presence and in the absence of RS102895, a specific CCR2 inhibitor. ICAM-1 expression was assessed both by immunofluorescence and cytofluorimetry. Monocyte-HMC interaction was tested by adhesion assay. CCR2 expression was studied by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry. HMCs exposure to rh-MCP-1 induced a significant twofold increase in ICAM-1 expression at 24 h, leading to enhanced monocyte adhesion. This effect occurred via the CCR2 receptor as CCR2 was expressed in HMCs and CCR2 blockade prevented ICAM-1 upregulation. Stretch-induced ICAM-1 expression was not altered by CCR2 blockade and stretch significantly reduced CCR2 mRNA and protein expression via an MCP-1-independent mechanism.",

        "input": "[PRE] Maternal obesity and gestational diabetes (GDM) are conditions associated with fetal overgrowth and excessive fat accumulation in the fetus, implicating an increased placental nutrient transfer in these pregnancies. Obese and GDM mothers have altered metabolism and hormone levels, including elevation of maternal circulatory lipids and pro-inflammatory cytokines. We tested the hypothesis that interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α stimulate placental fatty acid transport, as these pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to affect lipid metabolism in other tissues. In cultured primary human trophoblast cells IL-6, but not TNF-α, stimulated fatty acid accumulation, as measured by BODIPY fluorescence. The increased fatty acid accumulation could not be explained by an increased expression of key components in placental fatty acid transport, such as adipophilin, fatty acid transport protein (FATP)1, FATP4, or lipoprotein lipase. In a cohort of lean and overweight/obese pregnant women, increasing maternal third trimester IL-6 plasma concentrations correlated with decreasing placental lipoprotein lipase activity. However, as no effect on lipoprotein lipase activity was observed in cultured trophoblast cells after exposure to either IL-6 or TNF-α, the correlation between maternal circulatory IL-6 levels and placental lipoprotein lipase activity at term is unlikely to represent a cause-and-effect relationship.",

        "input": "[PRE] Ceramide regulates several different cellular responses including mechanisms leading to apoptosis. Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase (SGK)-1 is a serine threonine kinase, which activates survival pathways in response to stress stimuli. Recently, we demonstrated an anti-apoptotic role of SGK-1 in human umbilical endothelial cells treated with high glucose. In the present study, since ceramide induces apoptosis by multiple mechanisms in diabetes and its complication such as nephropathy, we aimed to investigate whether SGK-1 may protect even against apoptosis induced by ceramide in kidney cells. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells stable transfected with SGK-1 wild type (SGK-1wt) and its dominant negative gene (SGK-1dn) have been used in this study. Apoptotic stimuli were induced by C2-ceramide and TNF-α to increase endogenous synthesis of ceramide. Upon activation with these stimuli, SGK-1wt transfected cells have a statistically significant reduction of apoptosis compared with SGK-1dn cells (P<0.001). This protection was dependent on activation of caspase-3 and Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase-1 (PARP-1) cleavage. SGK-1 and AKT-1 two highly homologous kinases differently reacted to ceramide treatment, since SGK-1 increases in response to apoptotic stimulus while AKT-1 decreases. This enhancement of SGK-1 was dependent on p38-mitogen-activated-protein kinases (p38MAPK), cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Especially, by using selective LY294002 inhibitor, we demonstrated that the most involved pathway in the SGK-1 mediated process of protection was PI3K. Treatment with inhibitor of SGK-1 (GSK650394) significantly enhanced TNF-α-dependent apoptosis in HEK-293 cells overexpressing SGK-1wt. Caspase-3, -8 and -9 selective inhibitors confirmed that SGK-1 reduced the activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis, probably by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.",

However, the mechanism for the blood glucose-lowering effect remains unknown. To elucidate the impact of stevioside and its aglucon steviol on insulin release from normal mouse islets and the beta-cell line INS-1 were used. Both stevioside and steviol (1 nmol/L to 1 mmol/L) dose-dependently enhanced insulin secretion from incubated mouse islets in the presence of 16.7 mmol/L glucose (P < .05). The insulinotropic effects of stevioside and steviol were critically dependent on the prevailing glucose concentration, ie, stevioside (1 mmol/L) and steviol (1 micromol/L) only potentiated insulin secretion at or above 8.3 mmol/L glucose (P < .05). Interestingly, the insulinotropic effects of both stevioside and steviol were preserved in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. During perifusion of islets, stevioside (1 mmol/L) and steviol (1 micromol/L) had a long-lasting and apparently reversible insulinotropic effect in the presence of 16.7 mmol/L glucose (P < .05). To determine if stevioside and steviol act directly on beta cells, the effects on INS-1 cells were also investigated. Stevioside and steviol both potentiated insulin secretion from INS-1 cells (P < .05). Neither stevioside (1 to 100 micromol/L) nor steviol (10 nmol/L to 10 micromol/L) influenced the plasma membrane K+ adenosine triphosphate ((K+)ATP)-sensitive channel activity, nor did they alter cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in islets.",

To examine how diabetes interacts with a mildly compromised lipid metabolism, we introduced the diabetogenic Ins2(C96Y/+) (Akita) mutation into mice expressing human apoE4 (E4) combined with either an overexpressing human LDL receptor gene (hLDLR) or the wild-type mouse gene. The hLDLR allele caused 2-fold reductions in plasma HDL-cholesterol, plasma apoA1, and hepatic triglyceride secretion. Diabetes increased plasma total cholesterol 1.3-fold and increased apoB48 secretion 3-fold, while reducing triglyceride secretion 2-fold. Consequently, diabetic E4 mice with hLDLR secrete increased numbers of small, cholesterol-enriched, apoB48-containing VLDL, although they have near normal plasma cholesterol (<120 mg/dl). Small foam cell lesions were present in the aortic roots of all diabetic E4 mice with hLDLR that we analyzed at six months of age. None were present in nondiabetic mice or in diabetic mice without hLDLR. Aortic expression of genes affecting leukocyte recruitment and adhesion was enhanced by diabetes. ApoA1 levels, but not diabetes, were strongly correlated with the ability of plasma to efflux cholesterol from macrophages.",

        "input": "[PRE] The majority of diabetic patients develop neuropathy and there is an increasing prevalence of neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the mechanism behind this is poorly understood. Here we first observed that macroautophagy/autophagy was suppressed in the hippocampus of diabetic GK rats with hyperglycemia, whereas it was unchanged in ob/ob mice without hyperglycemia. Autophagy could be directly inhibited by high glucose in mouse primary hippocampal neurons. Moreover, autophagy was protective in high-glucose-induced neurotoxicity. Further studies revealed that autophagic flux was suppressed by high glucose due to impaired autophagosome synthesis illustrated by mRFP-GFP-LC3 puncta analysis. We showed that decreased autophagy was dependent on NO produced under high glucose conditions. Therefore, (LC-MS/MS)-based quantitative proteomic analysis of protein S-nitrosation was performed and a core autophagy protein, ATG4B was found to be S-nitrosated in the hippocampus of GK rats. ATG4B was also verified to be S-nitrosated in neuronal cells cultured with high glucose. The activities of ATG4B in the processing of unmodified, precursor Atg8-family proteins and in the deconjugation of PE from lipidated Atg8-family proteins, which are essential for efficient autophagosome biogenesis were both compromised by S-nitrosation at Cys189 and Cys292 sites. In addition, ATG4B processing of the GABARAPL1 precursor was affected the least by S-nitrosation compared with other substrates. Finally, ATG4B S-nitrosation was verified to be responsible for decreased autophagy and neurotoxicity in response to high glucose.",

Acute effect of metformin was also measured in vivo by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Metformin markedly inhibited glucose-induced Isc (approximately 77%) after mucosal addition. In addition, metformin reduced the glucose-induced abundance of SGLT-1 in BBM and increased those of GLUT2, concomitantly increasing the phosphorylation of intracellular AMPKalpha2. This effect of metformin was also observed using non-metabolizable sugar alpha3-O-methyl glucose. Transmural glucose transport measured in vitro was increased by 22% under metformin.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC1α) is one of the main transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. We hypothesized that increasing PGC1α expression in podocytes could protect from CKD. We found that PGC1α and mitochondrial transcript levels are lower in podocytes of patients and mouse models with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). To increase PGC1α expression, podocyte-specific inducible PGC1α-transgenic mice were generated by crossing nephrin-rtTA mice with tetO-Ppargc1a animals. Transgene induction resulted in albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of PGC1α in podocytes increased mitochondrial biogenesis and maximal respiratory capacity. PGC1α also shifted podocytes towards fatty acid usage from their baseline glucose preference. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that PGC1α induced podocyte proliferation. Histological lesions of mice with podocyte-specific PGC1α expression resembled collapsing focal segmental glomerular sclerosis.",

The present study evaluated the effect of AS‑IV on high glucose‑induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) injury and its possible mechanism. The result indicated that AS‑IV has a significant protective effect on high glucose‑induced HUVEC injury. AS‑IV could significantly promote cell proliferation, reduce apoptosis and decrease the protein and mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor‑α and interleukin‑1β in HUVECs. Furthermore, AS‑IV could decrease the expression of phosphorylated c‑Jun NH2‑terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylated apoptosis signal‑regulating kinase 1, cytochrome c, cleaved‑caspase‑9, cleaved‑caspase‑3 and the relative ratio of B‑cell lymphoma‑2 associated X protein/B‑cell lymphoma‑2 in HUVECs.",

It was found that Zucker diabetic fatty rats develop an age-dependent accumulation of myocardial CER leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis. However, administration of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma agonist decreased the content of CER and prevented cardiomyocyte apoptosis [Zhou et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2000;97:1784-9]. These data suggest that PPARgamma activators affect myocardial CER metabolism. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine the effects of pioglitazone, a selective PPARgamma agonist, on the content of CER and its metabolites and on the activity of key enzymes of CER metabolism in the heart. The experiments were conducted on rats fed either a standard chow (STD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 21 days. Each group was divided into two subgroups: control and treated with pioglitazone for 14 days. Surprisingly, administration of PPARgamma agonist significantly increased myocardial CER content in both STD and HFD rats. In the latter group an elevation in the amount of sphingomyelin was also observed. In STD rats pioglitazone treatment increased the activity of neutral sphingomyelinase and acid ceramidase. However, in HFD group the compound did not affect the activity of the aforementioned enzymes.

        "input": "[PRE] Insulin biosynthesis and secretion are critical for pancreatic beta-cell function, but both are impaired under diabetic conditions. We have found that hyperglycemia induces the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor c-Myc in islets in several different diabetic models. To examine the possible implication of c-Myc in beta-cell dysfunction, c-Myc was overexpressed in isolated rat islets using adenovirus. Adenovirus-mediated c-Myc overexpression suppressed both insulin gene transcription and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Insulin protein content, determined by immunostaining, was markedly decreased in c-Myc-overexpressing cells. In gel-shift assays c-Myc bound to the E-box in the insulin gene promoter region. Furthermore, in betaTC1, MIN6, and HIT-T15 cells and primary rat islets, wild type insulin gene promoter activity was dramatically decreased by c-Myc overexpression, whereas the activity of an E-box mutated insulin promoter was not affected. In HeLa and HepG2 cells c-Myc exerted a suppressive effect on the insulin promoter activity only in the presence of NeuroD/BETA2 but not PDX-1. Both c-Myc and NeuroD can bind the E-box element in the insulin promoter, but unlike NeuroD, the c-Myc transactivation domain lacked the ability to activate insulin gene expression. Additionally p300, a co-activator of NeuroD, did not function as a co-activator of c-Myc.",

We investigated whether Gap27 remains effective in augmenting scrape-wound closure in human skin wound models simulating diabetes-induced changes, using culture conditions with raised glucose, insulin and IGFBP-5. Gap27 increased scrape-wound closure in normal glucose and insulin (NGI) and to a lesser extent in high glucose and insulin (HGI). IGF-I enhanced scrape-wound closure in keratinocytes whereas IGFBP-5 inhibited this response. Gap27 overcame the inhibitory effects of IGFBP-5 on IGF-I activity. Connexin-mediated communication (CMC) was reduced in HGI, despite raised Cx43, and Gap27 significantly decreased CMC in NGI and HGI. IGF-I and IGFBP-5 did not affect CMC.

        "input": "[PRE] The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) serves as a nutrient sensor and has been implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes. We previously demonstrated that fatty acid oxidation was enhanced in transgenic mouse adipocytes, wherein the rate-limiting enzyme of the HBP, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFA), was overexpressed. To explore the molecular mechanism of the HBP-induced fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes, we studied AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor that stimulates fatty acid oxidation by regulating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activity. Phosphorylation and activity of AMPK were increased in transgenic fat pads and in 3T3L1 adipocytes treated with glucosamine to stimulate hexosamine flux. Glucosamine also stimulated phosphorylation of ACC and fatty acid oxidation in 3T3L1 adipocytes, and these stimulatory effects were diminished by adenovirus-mediated expression of a dominant negative AMPK in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Conversely, blocking the HBP with a GFA inhibitor reduced AMPK activity, ACC phosphorylation, and fatty acid oxidation. These changes are not explained by alterations in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio. Further demonstrating that AMPK is regulated by the HBP, we found that AMPK was recognized by succinylated wheat germ agglutinin, which specifically binds O-GlcNAc. The levels of AMPK in succinylated wheat germ agglutinin precipitates correlated with hexosamine flux in mouse fat pads and 3T3L1 adipocytes. Moreover, removal of O-GlcNAc by hexosaminidase reduced AMPK activity.",

The hypothalamus is a key center for the control of appetite and energy homeostasis. The ventromedial nucleus (VMH) and arcuate nucleus (ARC) are two critical nuclei involved in these processes. We have reported that R-spondin 1 (Rspo1) and its receptor leucin-rich repeat and G protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) in the VMH and ARC suppressed appetite, but the downstream neuronal pathways are unclear. Here we show that neurons containing cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) in ARC express both LGR4 and insulin receptor; intracerebroventricular injection of Rspo1 induced c-Fos expression in CART neurons of ARC; and silencing CART in ARC attenuated the anorexigenic actions of Rspo1. In diabetic and obese fa/fa rats, Rspo1 mRNA in VMH and CART mRNA in ARC were reduced; this was accompanied by increased food consumption. Insulin treatment restored Rspo1 and CART gene expressions and normalized eating behavior. Chronic intracerebroventricular injection of Rspo1 inhibited food intake and normalized diabetic hyperphagia; intracerebroventricular injection of Rspo1 or insulin increased CART mRNA in ARC. In the CART neuron cell line, Rspo1 and insulin potentiated each other on pERK and β-catenin, and in rats, they acted synergistically to inhibit food intake. Silencing Rspo1 in VMH reduced CART expression in ARC and attenuated the inhibitory effect of insulin on food intake.",

This study was designed to evaluate impacts of high levels of glucose on HSC activation, assess roles of the phytochemical curcumin in attenuating the glucose impacts, and elucidate underlying mechanisms. In this report, levels of intracellular glucose were measured. Contents and gene expression of glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2) in cell fractions were examined. Levels of cellular glutathione and oxidative stress were analyzed. We observed that high levels of glucose induced cell proliferation, type I collagen production and expression of genes relevant to HSC activation, and elevated intracellular glucose levels in cultured HSCs. Curcumin eliminated the stimulatory impacts. Curcumin abrogated the membrane translocation of GLUT2 by interrupting the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, curcumin suppressed glut2 expression by stimulating the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) and de novo synthesis of glutathione.",

In rat thyroid PCCL3 cells, both TSH and insulin decreased DUOX activity and DUOX1 mRNA levels, an effect partially reversed by protein kinase A inhibition. Most antioxidant enzymes remained unchanged or decreased in the thyroid of DM rats, whereas only glutathione peroxidase 3 was increased.

We have now identified a missense mutation, E1506K, within the second nucleotide binding fold of SUR1, found heterozygous in seven related patients with CHI and in their mothers. All patients have a mild form of CHI that usually can be managed by long-term diazoxide treatment. This clinical finding is in agreement with the results of heterologous coexpression studies of recombinant Kir6.2 and SUR1 carrying the E1506K mutation. Mutant K(ATP) channels were insensitive to metabolic inhibition, but a partial response to diazoxide was retained.

Although the exact mechanism of rosiglitazone (RSG) is unknown, our previous in vitro work showed how RSG, an oral anti-diabetic drug belonging to the family of thiazolidinedione class, can protect BBB integrity through enhancement of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) activity. Herein, we have validated the protective role of rosiglitazone against TS-induced BBB impairment in vivo. Our results revealed that RSG as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), activates counteractive mechanisms primarily associated with the upregulation of Nrf2 and PPARγ pathways which reduce TS-dependent toxicity at the cerebrovascular level. In line with these findings, our results show that RSG reduces inflammation and protects BBB integrity.",

Experimental diabetes mellitus has been shown to cause a decrease in the maximal contractile performance of the heart. We postulated that the decrease in contractile performance may be explained in part by a decrease in CK enzyme activity. To evaluate this possibility, we determined the level of CK activity and isoenzyme distribution in ventricular homogenates from normal, diabetic, and insulin-treated diabetic rats. We found that total CK activity was decreased by 35% in diabetic hearts and that a 66% reduction in the cardiac-specific MB isoenzyme occurs. Using a cDNA probe for CK-muscle (M) RNA in Northern blot analysis, we determined that a 61.1% decrease in CK-M mRNA occurs in diabetes. Chronic insulin therapy for 1 mo restores CK-M mRNA levels and enzyme activity.",

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) levels are up-regulated in patients with DN and in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) exposed to high glucose (HG). The underlying epigenetic mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we investigate the role of myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) in HG-induced CTGF transcription in RTECs. We report that in two different animal models of DN, one induced by streptozotocin (STZ) injection and the other induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, MRTF-A deficiency attenuated CTGF induction in the kidneys. In cultured RTECs, MRTF-A knockdown similarly ameliorated CTGF induction by HG treatment. Upon CTGF induction, there was an increase in acetylated histone H3 (AcH3) and trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4Me3) on the CTGF promoter region accompanying a decrease in dimethylated H3K9 (H3K9Me2). MRTF-A ablation in vivo or depletion in vitro comparably dampened the accumulation of AcH3 and H3K4Me3 but restored H3K9Me2 on the CTGF promoter. Further analyses revealed that MRTF-A interacted with and recruited histone demethylase KDM3A to the CTGF promoter to activate transcription. KDM3A silencing equivalently weakened HG-induced CTGF induction in RTECs.",

In this study, we evaluated its in vivo effects on the glucose homeostasis of rats made diabetic and insulin-deficient by streptozotocin. Na2SeO4 was administered ad libitum in drinking water and/or food for 10 weeks. The elevated plasma glucose levels (approximately 25 mmol/l) and glucosuria (approximately 85 mmol/day) of untreated rats were decreased by 50 and 80%, respectively, by selenate treatment. The beneficial effect of selenate was also evident during oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests: the integrated glucose responses were decreased by 40-50% as compared to those in untreated rats. These effects were not due to an increase in plasma insulin levels. Compared to non-diabetic rats, pancreatic insulin reserves were reduced by more than 90% in treated and untreated diabetic rats. The hepatic activities and mRNA levels of two key glycolytic enzymes, glucokinase and L-type pyruvate kinase were blunted in diabetic rats. They increased approximately two- to threefold after selenate treatment, to reach 40-75% of the values in non-diabetic rats. In contrast, elevated activity and mRNA levels of the gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, were reduced by 40-65% after selenate administration. Since selenate induced a moderate decrease in body weight due to an anorexigenic effect, we checked that there was no improvement of glucose homeostasis or hepatic glucose metabolism in an additional group of calorie-restricted diabetic rats, which was weight-matched with the selenate group. In addition, no obvious toxic side-effects on the kidney or liver were observed in the rats receiving selenate.",

This potentiating effect is known to be impaired in type 2 diabetic patients, but its cellular mechanisms are unclear. IS and cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) were measured in mouse islets during perifusion with 3-15 mmol/l glucose (G3-G15, respectively) and pulse or stepwise stimulation with 1-10 mmol/l arginine or 5-250 micromol/l tolbutamide. In G3, arginine induced small increases in [Ca(2+)](i) but no IS. G7 alone only slightly increased [Ca(2+)](i) and IS but markedly potentiated arginine effects on [Ca(2+)](i), which resulted in significant IS (already at 1 mmol/l). For each arginine concentration, both responses further increased at G10 and G15, but the relative change was distinctly larger for IS than [Ca(2+)](i). At all glucose concentrations, tolbutamide dose dependently increased [Ca(2+)](i) and IS with thresholds of 25 micromol/l for [Ca(2+)](i) and 100 micromol/l for IS at G3 and of 5 micromol/l for both at G7 and above. Between G7 and G15, the effect of tolbutamide on [Ca(2+)](i) increased only slightly, whereas that on IS was strongly potentiated. The linear relationship between IS and [Ca(2+)](i) at increasing arginine or tolbutamide concentrations became steeper as the glucose concentration was raised. Thus glucose augmented more the effect of each agent on IS than that on [Ca(2+)](i).",

It was also found that 3DG led to impaired plasma glucose homeostasis in healthy mice, however, the mechanisms underlying the deleterious effect of 3DG in diabetes remain to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the ability of 3DG to cause hepatic insulin resistance in a cell model by assessing glucose uptake and glycogen content. In addition, the molecular signaling events, including the phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/AKT/glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) and PI3K/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase‑3 (GSK‑3) pathways, which affect hepatic insulin resistance, were further investigated using Western blot analysis. The results showed that 3DG (10‑300 ng/ml) had no significant effect on HepG2 cell viability, however, the viability of the HepG2 cells decreased with exposure to concentrations of 500 and 1,000 ng/ml. Treatment with non‑cytotoxic 3DG concentrations resulted in decreased uptake of glucose and glycogen content with insulin stimulation, but not under basal conditions. The insulin‑induced expression of GLUT2 and p‑GSK‑3 were eliminated by 3DG (80 and 300 ng/ml), in addition to inhibiting the phosphorylation of downstream effectors of the insulin signaling pathway, including insulin receptor substrate 1, PI3K and AKT.",

ICA69 is encoded by the Ica1 gene on mouse chromosome 6 A1-A2. We previously reported reduced ICA69 expression in the thymus of NOD mice compared with thymus of several non-diabetic mouse strains. We propose that reduced thymic ICA69 expression could result from variations in transcriptional regulation of the gene and that polymorphisms within the Ica1 core promoter may partially determine this transcriptional variability. We characterized the functional promoter of Ica1 in NOD mice and compared it with the corresponding portions of Ica1 in non-diabetic C57BL/6 mice. Luciferase reporter constructs demonstrated that the NOD Ica1 promoter region exhibited markedly reduced luciferase expression in transiently transfected medullary thymus epithelial (mTEC(+)) and B-cell (M12)-derived cell lines. However, in a non-diabetic strain, C57BL/6, the Ica1 promoter region was transcriptionally active when transiently transfected into the same cell lines. We concomitantly identified five single nucleotide polymorphisms within the NOD Ica1 promoter. One of these single nucleotide polymorphisms increases the binding affinity for the transcription factor AIRE (autoimmune regulator), which is highly expressed in thymic epithelial cells, where it is known to play a key role regulating self-antigen expression.",

We show here that in the first 3 days after induction of hyperglycemia by streptozotocin, rats have levels of plasma glucagon and proglucagon messenger RNA comparable to those of normoglycemic controls despite hyperglycemia. With more prolonged diabetes, plasma glucagon and proglucagon messenger RNA levels increase; this increase is corrected by insulin treatment, but not by phloridzin despite normalization of the glycemia by both treatments.

        "input": "[PRE] Lipid accumulation is a central event in the development of chronic metabolic diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, but the mechanisms responsible for lipid accumulation are incompletely understood. This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms for excess nutrient-induced lipid accumulation and whether activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) prevents the hepatic lipid accumulation in excess nutrient-treated HepG2 cells and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Exposure of HepG2 cells to high levels of glucose or palmitate induced the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, activated sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), and enhanced lipid accumulation, all of which were sensitive to ER stress inhibitor and gene silencing of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α. The increases in ER stress response and lipid accumulation were associated with activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Inhibition of mTORC1 signaling attenuated the ER stress response and lipid accumulation induced by high glucose or by deletion of tuberous sclerosis 2. In addition, AMPK activation prevented the mTORC1 activation, ER stress response, and lipid accumulation. This effect was mimicked or abrogated, respectively, by overexpression of constitutively active and dominant-negative AMPK mutants. Finally, treatment of HFD-fed mice with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-4-ribofuranoside inhibited the mTORC1 pathway, suppressed the ER stress response, and prevented insulin resistance and hepatic lipid accumulation.",

We studied normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic (DM) Sprague-Dawley rats treated for 6 weeks with vehicle, ALISK, HCTZ, or AMLO individually and combined and evaluated the effects of treatments on BP, urine albumin to creatinine ratio, renal interstitial fluid levels of angiotensin II, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and renal expression of TNF-α, IL-6, transforming growth factor beta 1, and nuclear factor kappa B. There were no differences in BP between treatments. Only ALISK and its combinations reduced renal interstitial fluid angiotensin II. Urine albumin to creatinine ratio increased in DM rats and decreased with ALISK alone or combined with HCTZ or AMLO. HCTZ or AMLO individually and combined did not influence urine albumin to creatinine ratio. Renal interstitial fluid TNF-α and IL-6, and the renal expression of TNF-α, IL-6, transforming growth factor beta 1, and nuclear factor kappa B were increased in DM rats. These renal inflammatory markers were reduced only with ALISK or AMLO individually or combined with other treatments.",

        "input": "[PRE] Exendin-4 (Ex-4), a long-acting agonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, is a novel anti-diabetic drug that prevents β-cells against various toxicities. However, the mechanism and molecules mediating the protection procession of Ex-4 are not fully understood. We investigated the protective effect of Ex-4 against lipotoxicity, mediated by a repression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, a regulator of genes expression involved in fat and cholesterol synthesis. To observe the effect of Ex-4, we evaluated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and apoptosis in the MIN6 pancreatic β-cell line, which were cultured in DMEM medium containing 500 μM palmitate, with or without 10 nM Ex-4. We also examined the roles of SREBP-1c in lipotoxicity model by knockdown with si-RNA. Treatment with Ex-4 improved insulin secretion and survival as well as reduced SREBP-1c expression and activity in palmitate-treated MIN6 cells. This improvement was accompanied with an upregulation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and LY294.002, a specific inhibitor of PI3 kinase, abrogated effects of Ex-4 on insulin secretion. Moreover, SREBP-1c in nuclei was increased by the inhibition of PI3 kinase. Lipotoxic effects of palmitate in the insulin secretion and apoptosis were significantly prevented by SREBP-1 knockdown.",

        "input": "[PRE] Dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors are a new class of antidiabetic drugs. It is urgent, therefore, to fully understand the pharmacology of these inhibitors. Although dipeptidyl peptidase IV metabolizes at least 24 endogenous substrates, the pharmacological consequences of inhibiting the metabolism of most of these substrates is unknown. Our previous results show that Y(1) receptors, but not Y(2) receptors, enhance renovascular responses to angiotensin II in kidneys from genetically susceptible animals (spontaneously hypertensive rats). Dipeptidyl peptidase IV converts peptide YY(1-36) (circulating hormone) to peptide YY(3-36), and peptide YY(1-36) is a Y(1)-receptor agonist, whereas peptide YY(3-36) is a selective Y(2)-receptor agonist. Therefore, it is conceivable that inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV in genetically susceptible kidneys may increase the ability of peptide YY(1-36) to potentiate angiotensin II-induced renal vasoconstriction. Here we demonstrate that in kidneys from spontaneously hypertensive rats 1) peptide YY(1-36) potentiates renovascular responses to angiotensin II, whereas peptide YY(3-36) has little effect, 2) 3-N-[(2S,3S)-2-amino-3-methylpentanoyl]-1,3-thiazolidine (P32/98) (dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor) augments the ability of peptide YY(1-36) to enhance renovascular responses to angiotensin II, 3) dipeptidyl peptidase IV is expressed in preglomerular microvessels and glomeruli, 4) kidneys metabolize arterial PYY(1-36) to PYY(3-36) via a mechanism blocked by P32/98, and 5) preglomerular microvessels and glomeruli convert peptide YY(1-36) to peptide YY(3-36), and this conversion is inhibited by P32/98.",

        "input": "[PRE] Apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB) is the main protein of the atherogenic lipoproteins and plasma ApoB levels reflect the total numbers of atherogenic lipoproteins. Induction of insulin resistance was accompanied by a considerable rise in the production of hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) containing ApoB and triglyceride. Increased plasma levels of ApoB and triglyceride in VLDL are common characteristics of the dyslipidemia associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thus, we investigate whether phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced insulin resistance affects the increase of ApoB secretion. PMA increased ApoB secretion and transcriptional level of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). PMA treatment also resulted in increase of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) serine312 (Ser312) and serine1101 (Ser1101) phosphorylation and induction of IRS1 degradation. Additionally, PMA induced activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (alpha, betaI, delta, zeta, theta), and reduced AKT8 virus oncogene cellular homolog (AKT) activation in a time dependent manner. PMA-induced ApoB secretion, MTP promoter activities, and IRS1 degradation was significantly decreased by treatment of JNK and PKCs inhibitors.

In the present study, high glucose (HG)‑treated human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK‑2) were used to examine the protective effects of PPS against HG‑stimulated apoptosis and inflammation. The results of the study revealed that PPS markedly suppressed the HG‑induced reduction in cell viability. Incubation of HK‑2 cells with HG activated the p38 MAPK pathway and, subsequently, as confirmed by western blot analysis and flow cytometry, increased cell apoptosis, which was blocked by PPS. In addition, PPS treatment significantly inhibited HG‑stimulated p38 MAPK and nuclear factor‑κB activation, and reduced the production of pro‑inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β and IL‑6.",

These studies have evaluated the relationship between renal PG synthesis and hormone levels in rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus, a species devoid of circulating ADH. Since vasoconstrictor agents can stimulate renal PG synthesis by mechanisms unrelated to antidiuretic activity, deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) was utilized for replacement therapy instead of arginine vasopressin, which has considerable pressor activity. dDAVP was administered by S.C. implanted osmotic minipumps to obtain steady states of dDAVP at different dose levels. As indices of renal PG synthesis, urinary excretion of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. PGE2 excretion, although increased by dDAVP treatment, was not correlated with dose of dDAVP. However, PGF2 alpha excretion was highly correlated with dose of dDAVP (r = 0.97, P less than .01). The sum (PGE2 + PGF2 alpha), which may more accurately reflect total medullary PG synthesis, was also significantly correlated with dose of dDAVP (r = 0.98, P less than .001).",

        "input": "[PRE] Leptin, the satiety hormone expressed almost exclusively in adipose tissue, is a marker of body fat accumulation in humans. Recent studies have shown that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a prothrombotic factor associated with atherosclerosis complications, is also produced in adipose tissue. The objective of the present study was to determine whether PAI-1 antigen plasma concentrations are associated with leptin plasma levels or the body fat mass (FM) independently of the variables known to influence PAI-1 production. Sixty-one nondiabetic women aged 18 to 45 years with a wide range of values for the body mass index ([BMI] 18.1 to 37.7 kg/m2) were evaluated for (1) body FM and fasting plasma levels of (2) PAI-1 antigen, (3) PAI-1 activity, (4) leptin, (5) insulin, (6) blood glucose, and (7) lipids (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol, and triglycerides [TG]). Body FM and fat-free mass (FFM) were estimated during fasting conditions by the bioimpedance analysis (BIA) method using a tetrapolar device. Body fat distribution was evaluated by the waist circumference and the waist to hip ratio (WHR). FM was directly associated with both PAI-1 antigen (r = .585, P < .001) and PAI-1 activity (r = .339, P < .001). Seemingly, leptin was positively related to both PAI-1 antigen (r = .630, P < .001) and PAI-1 activity (r = .497, P < .001). Moreover, both PAI-I antigen and PAI-1 activity were directly correlated with FFM (r = .285, P < .05, and r = .336, P < .01, respectively), BMI (r = .594, P < .001, and r = .458, P < .001, respectively), and WHR (r = .510, P < .001, and r = .391, P < .005, respectively). Insulin was directly related to PAI-1 antigen (r = .540, P < .001), PAI-1 activity (r = .259, P < .05), leptin (r = .447, P < .001), and FM (r = .435, P < .001). The association between PAI-1 antigen (dependent variable) and leptin or FM was tested by a stepwise regression model simultaneously including leptin, FM, BMI, WHR, age, FFM, and fasting insulin, blood glucose, TG, cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol as independent variables. PAI-1 antigen maintained a significant positive independent relationship only with leptin (t = 2.923, P < .01), insulin (t = 3.489, P < .001), and fasting blood glucose (t = 2.092, P < .05), and a negative independent relationship with HDL-cholesterol (t = -2.634, P < .05).",

The glucose clamp studies revealed a approximately 30% increased glucose disposal, increased hepatic glucose output (HGO) suppression from approximately 30 to 60%, and an increased free fatty acid suppression from 40 to 75%. Therefore, TPM treatment led to enhanced insulin sensitivity at the level of tissue glucose disposal (increased ISGDR), liver (increased inhibition of HGO), and adipose tissue (enhanced suppression of lipolysis). When soleus muscle strips of control or TPM-treated ZDF rats were studied ex vivo, insulin-stimulated glucose transport was not enhanced in the drug-treated animals. In contrast, when isolated adipocytes were studied ex vivo, a marked increase (+55%) in insulin-stimulated glucose transport was observed. In vitro treatment of muscle strips and rat adipocytes showed no effect on glucose transport in muscle with a 40% increase in insulin-stimulated adipocyte glucose transport.",

        "input": "[PRE] During lipid oversupply, the heart becomes insulin resistant, as exemplified by defective insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and will develop diastolic dysfunction. In the healthy heart, not only insulin, but also increased contractile activity stimulates glucose uptake. Upon increased contraction both AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase D (PKD) are activated, and mediate the stimulation of glucose uptake into cardiomyocytes. Therefore, each of these kinases is a potential therapeutic target in the diabetic heart because they may serve to bypass defective insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. To test the preventive potential of these kinases against loss of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, AMPK or PKD were adenovirally overexpressed in primary cultures of insulin resistant cardiomyocytes for assaying substrate uptake, insulin responsiveness and lipid accumulation. To induce insulin resistance and lipid loading, rat primary cardiomyocytes were cultured in the presence of high insulin (100 nM; HI) or high palmitate (palmitate/BSA: 3/1; HP). HI and HP each reduced insulin responsiveness, and increased basal palmitate uptake and lipid storage. Overexpression of each of the kinases prevented loss of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Overexpression of AMPK also prevented loss of insulin signaling in HI- and HP-cultured cardiomyocytes, but did not prevent lipid accumulation. In contrast, overexpression of PKD prevented lipid accumulation, but not loss of insulin signaling in HI- and HP-cultured cardiomyocytes.",

Therefore, we investigated the effects of glucose on Ang II-mediated activation of Janus-activated kinase (JAK)-2, a tyrosine kinase related with myocyte hypertrophy and cytokine and fibrogenetic growth factor overexpression, in ventricular myocytes isolated from nonfailing human hearts (n = 5) and failing human hearts (n = 8). In nonfailing myocytes, JAK2 phosphorylation was enhanced by Ang II only in the presence of high glucose (25 mmol/l) via Ang II type I (AT1) receptors (+79% vs. normal glucose, P < 0.05). JAK2 activation was prevented by inhibitors of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (diphenyleneiodonium [DPI], tiron, and apocynin). In myocytes isolated from failing hearts, JAK2 phosphorylation was enhanced by high glucose alone (+107%, P < 0.05). High glucose-induced JAK2 activation was blunted by both ACE inhibition (100 nmol/l ramipril) and AT1 antagonism (1 mumol/l valsartan), thus revealing that the effects are mediated by autocrine Ang II production. Inhibition of ROS generation also prevented high glucose-induced JAK2 phosphorylation.",

        "input": "[PRE] Vascular inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Recently, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) trans-signaling via soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) has emerged as a prominent regulator of inflammation in endothelial cells. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that selective inhibition of the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway will attenuate inflammation and subsequent barrier disruption in retinal endothelial cells. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were exposed to IL-6 and sIL-6R to induce IL-6 trans-signaling and the commercially available compound sgp130Fc (soluble gp-130 fused chimera) was used to selectively inhibit IL-6 trans-signaling. IL-6 trans-signaling activation caused a significant increase in STAT3 phosphorylation, expression of adhesion molecules, ROS production and apoptosis in HRECs whereas a significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and NO production was observed in IL-6 trans-signaling activated cells. These changes were not observed in cells pre-treated with sgp130Fc. IL-6 trans-signaling activation was sufficient to cause barrier disruption in endothelial monolayers and pre-treatment of HRECs with sgp130Fc, maintained endothelial barrier function similar to that of untreated cells.",

Renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure (RIHP) has been shown to play a critical role in mediating sodium and water excretion under various conditions. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of immediate and delayed initiation of insulin treatment on the restoration of the relationship between RIHP, natriuretic, and diuretic responses to acute saline volume expansion (VE) in diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 65 mg/kg body wt). Four groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats were studied: normal control group (C), untreated diabetic group (D), immediate insulin-treated diabetic group (DI; treatment with insulin for 2 wk was initiated immediately when diabetes was confirmed, which was 2 days after STZ injection), and delayed insulin-treated diabetic group (DDI; treatment with insulin for 2 wk was initiated 2 wk after STZ injection). RIHP and sodium and water excretions were measured before and during VE (5% body wt/30 min) in the four groups of anesthetized rats. VE significantly increased RIHP, fractional excretion of sodium (FE(Na)), and urine flow rate (V) in all groups of rats. Basal RIHP, RIHP response to VE (Delta RIHP), and FE(Na) and V responses to VE (Delta FE(Na) and Delta V) were significantly lower in the D group compared with the C group of rats. Delta RIHP was significantly higher in both DI and DDI groups compared with D group but was similar to that of the C group of rats. While in the DI group the Delta FE(Na) response to VE was restored, Delta FE(Na) was significantly increased in DDI compared with D group, but it remained lower than that of the C group.",

        "input": "[PRE] Curcumin has been observed to exhibit an anti-fibrotic effect in the liver, lung and gallbladder. However, the mechanisms underlying the cytoprotective effects of curcumin remain to be elucidated. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of mature tubular epithelial cells in the kidney is considered to contribute to the renal accumulation of matrix proteins associated with diabetic nephropathy. The EMT is also closely associated with the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis and oxidative stress. This process may occur through abrogation of high glucose (HG)-induced oxidative stress via activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in kidney tubular epithelial cells. In the present study, the effect of curcumin on HG-induced EMT in the NRK-52E normal rat kidney tubular epithelial cell line was investigated, and whether the effect of curcumin was mediated by the induction of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression was examined. The present study revealed that curcumin was able to prevent events associated with EMT, including the downregulation of E-cadherin and the increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin. Further analysis revealed that the expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 protein were elevated to a greater extent in the curcumin pretreated NRK-52E cells compared with those of the control. Notably, knockdown of Nrf2 with small interfering RNA prevented the curcumin-induced elevation in expression of HO-1 and the associated anti-fibrotic effects.",

Induction of insulin resistance was accompanied by a considerable rise in the production of hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) containing ApoB and triglyceride. Increased plasma levels of ApoB and triglyceride in VLDL are common characteristics of the dyslipidemia associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thus, we investigate whether phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced insulin resistance affects the increase of ApoB secretion. PMA increased ApoB secretion and transcriptional level of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). PMA treatment also resulted in increase of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) serine312 (Ser312) and serine1101 (Ser1101) phosphorylation and induction of IRS1 degradation. Additionally, PMA induced activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (alpha, betaI, delta, zeta, theta), and reduced AKT8 virus oncogene cellular homolog (AKT) activation in a time dependent manner. PMA-induced ApoB secretion, MTP promoter activities, and IRS1 degradation was significantly decreased by treatment of JNK and PKCs inhibitors. Orthovanadate, a potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and decreased ApoB secretion of Chang liver cells although PMA was co-treated.",

        "input": "[PRE] The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) serves as a nutrient sensor and has been implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes. We previously demonstrated that fatty acid oxidation was enhanced in transgenic mouse adipocytes, wherein the rate-limiting enzyme of the HBP, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFA), was overexpressed. To explore the molecular mechanism of the HBP-induced fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes, we studied AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor that stimulates fatty acid oxidation by regulating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activity. Phosphorylation and activity of AMPK were increased in transgenic fat pads and in 3T3L1 adipocytes treated with glucosamine to stimulate hexosamine flux. Glucosamine also stimulated phosphorylation of ACC and fatty acid oxidation in 3T3L1 adipocytes, and these stimulatory effects were diminished by adenovirus-mediated expression of a dominant negative AMPK in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Conversely, blocking the HBP with a GFA inhibitor reduced AMPK activity, ACC phosphorylation, and fatty acid oxidation. These changes are not explained by alterations in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio. Further demonstrating that AMPK is regulated by the HBP, we found that AMPK was recognized by succinylated wheat germ agglutinin, which specifically binds O-GlcNAc. The levels of AMPK in succinylated wheat germ agglutinin precipitates correlated with hexosamine flux in mouse fat pads and 3T3L1 adipocytes. Moreover, removal of O-GlcNAc by hexosaminidase reduced AMPK activity.",

        "input": "[PRE] Dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors are a new class of antidiabetic drugs. It is urgent, therefore, to fully understand the pharmacology of these inhibitors. Although dipeptidyl peptidase IV metabolizes at least 24 endogenous substrates, the pharmacological consequences of inhibiting the metabolism of most of these substrates is unknown. Our previous results show that Y(1) receptors, but not Y(2) receptors, enhance renovascular responses to angiotensin II in kidneys from genetically susceptible animals (spontaneously hypertensive rats). Dipeptidyl peptidase IV converts peptide YY(1-36) (circulating hormone) to peptide YY(3-36), and peptide YY(1-36) is a Y(1)-receptor agonist, whereas peptide YY(3-36) is a selective Y(2)-receptor agonist. Therefore, it is conceivable that inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV in genetically susceptible kidneys may increase the ability of peptide YY(1-36) to potentiate angiotensin II-induced renal vasoconstriction. Here we demonstrate that in kidneys from spontaneously hypertensive rats 1) peptide YY(1-36) potentiates renovascular responses to angiotensin II, whereas peptide YY(3-36) has little effect, 2) 3-N-[(2S,3S)-2-amino-3-methylpentanoyl]-1,3-thiazolidine (P32/98) (dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor) augments the ability of peptide YY(1-36) to enhance renovascular responses to angiotensin II, 3) dipeptidyl peptidase IV is expressed in preglomerular microvessels and glomeruli, 4) kidneys metabolize arterial PYY(1-36) to PYY(3-36) via a mechanism blocked by P32/98, and 5) preglomerular microvessels and glomeruli convert peptide YY(1-36) to peptide YY(3-36), and this conversion is inhibited by P32/98.",

G6PC2 encodes an islet-specific, endoplasmic reticulum-resident glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit. A combination of in situ perfused pancreas, in vitro isolated islet, and in vivo analyses were used to explore the function of G6pc2 in mice. G6pc2 deletion had little effect on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, whereas body fat was reduced in female G6pc2 knockout (KO) mice on both a chow and high-fat diet, observations that are all consistent with human GWAS data. G6pc2 deletion resulted in a leftward shift in the dose-response curve for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). As a consequence, under fasting conditions in which plasma insulin levels were identical, blood glucose levels were reduced in G6pc2 KO mice, again consistent with human GWAS data. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity was reduced, whereas basal cytoplasmic calcium levels were elevated in islets isolated from G6pc2 KO mice. These data suggest that G6pc2 represents a novel, negative regulator of basal GSIS that acts by hydrolyzing glucose-6-phosphate, thereby reducing glycolytic flux.",

A novel polymer coating consisting of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microsphere dispersed in poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels was evaluated in combination with dummy sensors as a \"smart\" drug eluting biocompatible coating for implantable biosensors to prevent the foreign body response, and thus enhance sensor performance in vivo. The polymeric microspheres slowly release tissue-modifying drugs at the implantation sites to control the inflammation and fibrous encapsulation, while the hydrogel allows rapid analyte diffusion to the sensing elements. Dummy sensors with identical dimensions to that of the functional glucose sensors (0.5×0.5×5mm) were coated with the PLGA/PVA composites using a mold fabrication process. Both normal and diabetic rats were used in the current study to investigate the effect of the diabetic state on tissue sensor interactions. It was evident that the PLGA/PVA hydrogel composite was able to form a uniform coating around the dummy sensor and stayed intact throughout the course of the study (one month). Tissue samples containing dummy sensors that were coated with dexamethasone free composites exhibited acute and chronic inflammation as well as fibrous encapsulation in both normal and diabetic rats. However, the diabetic rats exhibited decreased intensity and delayed onset of the foreign body response following implantation of drug free dummy sensors in comparison to those of normal rats. On the other hand, tissues containing dummy sensors that were coated with dexamethasone containing composites remained normal (i.e. similar to untreated tissues), with no inflammatory reaction or fibrous encapsulation occurring over the one-month period in both the normal and diabetic rats. The feasibility of utilizing PLGA microsphere/PVA hydrogel composites as coatings for implantable biosensors was demonstrated. This polymeric composite is an innovative approach to control the foreign body reaction at the tissue-device interface to prolong biosensor lifetime.",

Rosuvastatin is an OATP1B1 substrate and often concomitantly prescribed with oral antidiabetics in the clinic. The aim of this study was to investigate possible drug-drug interactions between these drugs at the level of OATP1B1 and OATP1B1*15. We generated human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells stably overexpressing OATP1B1 or OATP1B1*15 that showed similar protein expression levels of OATP1B1 and OATP1B1*15 at the cell membrane as measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In HEK-OATP1B1*15 cells, the V(max) for OATP1B1-mediated transport of E(2)17β-G (estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide) was decreased >60%, whereas K(m) values (Michaelis constant) were comparable. Uptake of rosuvastatin in HEK-OATP1B1 cells (K(m) 13.1 ± 0.43 μM) was nearly absent in HEK-OATP1B1*15 cells. Interestingly, several oral antidiabetics (glyburide, glimepiride, troglitazone, pioglitazone, glipizide, gliclazide, and tolbutamide), but not metformin, were identified as significant inhibitors of the OATP1B1-mediated transport of rosuvastatin. The IC(50) values for inhibition of E(2)17β-G uptake were similar between OATP1B1 and OATP1B1*15. In conclusion, these studies indicate that several oral antidiabetic drugs affect the OATP1B1-mediated uptake of rosuvastatin in vitro. The next step will be to translate these data to the clinical situation, as it remains to be established whether the studied oral antidiabetics indeed affect the clinical pharmacokinetic profile of rosuvastatin in patients.",

The dataset for analysis comprised 7,597 cases. Proportions meeting process and outcome criteria were determined, including between-country variations. Logistic regression was used to investigate potential predictors of meeting targets for HbA1c, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol.RESULTSIn the total sample, adherence to process recommendations was high for some measures, for example, HbA1c recorded in past 12 months in 97.6% of cases. Target achievement for intermediate outcome measures was lower, with only 53.6% having HbA1c <7%. Considerable between-country variation was identified for both processes and outcomes. The following characteristics were associated with an increased likelihood of meeting targets for all three measures considered (HbA1c, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol): shorter diagnosis of diabetes; having one or more macrovascular complications; lower BMI; being prescribed lipid-lowering medication; and no current antihypertensive prescribing.CONCLUSIONSCompared with earlier reports, we have suggested some encouraging positive trends in Europe in relation to meeting targets for the management of people with type 2 diabetes, but there is still scope for further improvement and greater between-country consistency.",

Short peptide toxins isolated from scorpion venoms are able to block voltage-dependent or Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. Here, we have studied the venom of the Moroccan scorpion Buthus occitanus Paris (BoP) in order to find new peptides, which could enlarge our structure-function relationship knowledge on the Kv1.3 blocker Kaliotoxin (KTX) that belongs to the α-KTx3.1 family. Indeed and since more a decade, KTX is widely used by international investigators because it exhibits a quite sharp specificity and a high-affinity for the Kv1.3 channel, which is not only a neuronal channel but also a therapeutic target for diverse autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. The BoP venom was first investigated using HPLC and MALDI-TOF/MS. Further, the HPLC fractions were screened by ELISA with antibodies raised against KTX. These antibodies recognized at least three components toxic in mice by intracerebroventricular injection. They were further pharmacologically characterized by competition using (125)I-KTX bound to its specific binding sites on rat brain synaptosomes. A single component (4161 Da) inhibited totally the (125)I-KTX binding and with high-affinity (IC50 = 0.1 nM), while the two other components poorly competed with (IC50 > 100 nM). These toxins were sequenced in full by Edman's degradation. The high-affinity ligand (BoPKTX) shares 86% sequence identity with KTX and was classified as toxin α-KTx3.17. The two others peptides (BoP1 and BoP2, 4093 Da and 4121 Da, respectively) only differ by a Lys/Arg mutation. Their amino acid sequences were related to Martentoxin, which has been characterized from the Chinese scorpion Buthus martenzi Karch and described as both a BKCa and Kv1.3 blocker.

        "input": "Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) plays a central role in cellular energy metabolism, and dysregulation of GSK-3 activity is implicated in a variety of metabolic disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Hence, GSK-3 has emerged as an attractive target molecule for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Therefore, this research focused on identification and characterization of a novel small-molecule GSK-3 inhibitor. Compound 1a, a structure based on 3-hydroxychromone bearing isothiazolidine-1,1-dione, was identified from chemical library as a highly potent GSK-3 inhibitor. An in vitro kinase assay utilizing a panel of kinases demonstrated that compound 1a strongly inhibits GSK-3β. The potential effects of compound 1a on the inactivation of GSK-3 were confirmed in human liver HepG2 and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. Stabilization of glycogen synthase and β-catenin, which are direct targets of GSK-3, by compound 1a was assessed in comparison with two other GSK-3 inhibitors: LiCl and SB-415286. In mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, compound 1a markedly blocked adipocyte differentiation. Consistently, intraperitoneal administration of compound 1a to diet-induced obese mice significantly ameliorated their key symptoms such as body weight gain, increased adiposity, dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis due to the marked reduction of whole-body lipid level. In vitro and in vivo effects were accompanied by upregulation of β-catenin stability and downregulation of the expression of several critical genes related to lipid metabolism. From these results, it can be concluded that compound 1a, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of GSK-3, has potential as a new class of therapeutic agent for obesity treatment.",

This article reviews the pharmacological properties, therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of oral lorcaserin in this patient population. In three large randomized, double-blind, multicentre studies, oral lorcaserin was more effective than placebo in the management of obese and overweight adults with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following 12 months' therapy, significantly higher proportions of lorcaserin than placebo recipients achieved a ≥5 and ≥10 % reduction from baseline in their bodyweight and a significant between-group difference favouring lorcaserin over placebo was observed for the change from baseline in bodyweight. Moreover, among patients who had achieved a ≥5 % reduction in their bodyweight after 12 months' therapy with lorcaserin, a significantly higher proportion who received lorcaserin for a further 12 months than those who switched to placebo maintained ≥5 % weight loss at 24 months. In general, oral lorcaserin was well tolerated in clinical studies, with hypoglycaemia and headache the most frequently reported adverse events in those with or without type 2 diabetes, respectively. According to a pooled analysis, the risk of US-FDA-defined valvulopathy with lorcaserin is generally low and not statistically significantly different from placebo. From these and other data, the FDA has concluded that lorcaserin is unlikely to elevate the risk of valvulopathy.",

Suspensions of L. johnsonii or an equal volume of vehicle were orally administered to BBDP rats. Tissue IDO was investigated using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, whereas tryptophan, kynurenine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentrations were quantified by HPLC and ELISA. IDO activity was also investigated using L. johnsonii culture cell-free supernatant (CFS) with affinity-purified IDO and HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells. L. johnsonii feeding resulted in a 17% reduction in serum kynurenine compared with that in vehicle-fed controls, correlating with a 1.4-fold elevation in 5-HT levels. H2O2 produced by L. johnsonii abolished IDO activity in vitro, and L. johnsonii feeding resulted in a 3.9-fold increase in ileum lumen H2O2. L. johnsonii CFS significantly reduced IDO activity in HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells (47% reduction) compared with that in vehicle-treated controls, an effect abolished by catalase treatment.

        "input": "The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a major therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes due to its role in glucose homeostasis. Despite the availability of peptide-based GLP-1R drugs for treatment of this disease, there is great interest in developing small molecules that can be administered orally. The GLP-1R system is complex, with multiple endogenous and clinically used peptide ligands that exhibit different signaling biases at this receptor. This study revealed that small molecule ligands acting at this receptor are differentially biased to peptide ligands and also from each other with respect to the signaling pathways that they activate. Furthermore, allosteric small molecule ligands were also able to induce bias in signaling mediated by orthosteric ligands. This was dependent on both the orthosteric and allosteric ligand as no two allosteric-orthosteric ligand pairs could induce the same signaling profile. We highlight the need to profile compounds across multiple signaling pathways and in combination with multiple orthosteric ligands in systems such as the GLP-1R where more than one endogenous ligand exists. In the context of pleiotropical coupling of receptors and the interplay of multiple pathways leading to physiologic responses, profiling of small molecules in this manner may lead to a better understanding of the physiologic consequences of biased signaling at this receptor. This could enable the design and development of improved therapeutics that have the ability to fine-tune receptor signaling, leading to beneficial therapeutic outcomes while reducing side effect profiles.",

        "input": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) continues being the primary cause of chronic hemodialysis and terminal renal disease worldwide. At tissue levels the DN occurs with glomerulopathy affecting the integrity of the filtration barrier and with an extensive glomerular and tubule-interstitial fibrosis. Current available therapeutic approaches have only demonstrated a modest effect on progression of kidney injury. Therefore, more research concerning the pathomechanisms and possible interventions are needed. Interestingly, in the last years it has been documented that DN progresses with growing levels of the nucleoside adenosine. This finding increased the interest in the events controlling the extracellular levels of the nucleoside. While the metabolism of extracellular ATP and cyclic AMP are well recognized sources, evidences regarding the role of the equilibrative nucleoside transporters in controlling adenosine availability and promoting diabetic glomerulopathy have recently acquired a pivotal role. The physiological effects of nucleoside are mediated by the P1 family of adenosine receptors. It has been shown in vivo that the use of an antagonist of the A2B receptor subtype can block the most remarkable early alterations seen in diabetic glomerulopathy. Furthermore, using models of chronic kidney injury it was demonstrated that fibrosis can also be blocked using treatment with the antagonist of A2B receptor subtype. This review highlights these findings that correlate the activity of a low affinity adenosine receptor with an increase in the ligand availability in the pathological state. In addition, we discuss the possible therapeutic interventions of adenosine signaling with regards to DN treatment.",

        "input": "Metformin hydrochloride (MH), a biguanide antidiabetic, is the drug of choice in obese patients. It is well absorbed from the upper part of gastrointestinal tract and has oral bioavailability of 50% to 60%. The objective of this study was to formulate MH into floating microspheres in order to increase its residence time at the site of absorption and thus improve its bioavailability; and to extend the duration of action along with possibilities of dose reduction. Microspheres were prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation method and evaluated for particle size, entrapment efficiency, buoyancy, and in vitro release; and further characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of selected formulation was carried out in male Wistar diabetic rats. The data was statistically analyzed by unpaired t-test. A 3.5-fold increase in relative bioavailability was observed. The prolongation of half-life (t(1/2)) from 4.5 ± 2.41 h to 14.12 ± 4.81 h indicated extended duration of action. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnet multiple comparison test, a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the blood glucose levels was observed when formulations were compared with control rats. Hence, MH floating microspheres were tested at 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg body weight, OGTT data showed nonsignificant difference (p >0.05). In conclusion, an effective oral antidiabetics treatment can be achieved by formulating MH into floating microspheres which results in increase in bioavailability along with extended duration of action resulting in possible reduction in dose.",

        "input": "Angiogenesis is tightly associated with the outgrowth of adipose tissue, leading to obesity, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and hypertension, mainly because expanding adipose tissue requires an increased nutrient supply from blood vessels. Therefore, induction of vessel abnormality by adipokines has been well studied, whereas how altered vascular function promotes obesity is relatively unexplored. Also, surviving Prox1 heterozygous mice showed abnormal lymphatic patterning and adult-onset obesity, indicating that accumulation of adipocytes could be closely linked with lymphatic function. Here we propose a new anti-obesity strategy based on enhancement of lymphatic and blood vessel integrity with apelin. Apelin-knockout mice given a high-fat diet showed an obese phenotype associated with abnormal lymphatic and blood vessel enlargement. Fatty acids present in the high-fat diet induced hyperpermeability of endothelial cells, causing adipocyte differentiation, whereas apelin promoted vascular stabilization. Moreover, treatment of high-fat-diet-fed apelin-knockout mice with a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, improved vascular function, and also attenuated obesity. Finally, apelin transgenic mice showed decreased subcutaneous adipose tissue owing to inhibition of high-fat-diet-induced hyperpermeability of vessels. These results indicate that apelin inhibits high-fat-diet-induced obesity by enhancing vessel integrity. Apelin could serve as a therapeutic target for treating obesity and related diseases.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: We evaluated prevalence and severity of angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD) according to groups by metabolically obese (MO) and/or weight status. MATERIAL/METHODS: Normal weight was defined as body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2))<25 and obesity was defined as BMI≥25. The MO was determined using the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III classification with Korean-specific cutoffs for abdominal obesity. Therefore, a total of 856 subjects were categorized as follows: (1) metabolically healthy and normal weight (MHNW); (2) metabolically obese but normal weight (MONW); (3) metabolically healthy but obese (MHO); and (4) metabolically abnormally obese (MAO). The presence of obstructive lesion≥50% of coronary artery was considered as an angiographic CAD and the Gensini scoring system was used for the severity. RESULTS: MONW or MO showed a higher prevalence of CAD than MHNW or non-MO after adjustment for age and sex, respectively (MONW, odds ratio [OR]=1.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-2.51 and MO, OR=1.44, 95% CI: 1.09-1.91). In subjects without diabetes mellitus (DM), MONW or MO showed a marginally higher prevalence of CAD (MONW, OR=1.58, 95% CI: 0.96-2.61 and MO, OR=1.41, 95% CI: 0.96-2.08). MONW was independently associated with a higher severity of angiographic CAD than MHNW after age, sex, glomerular filtration rate, smoking status, high sensitive C-reactive protein, and use of anti-platelet and anti-angina drugs (β=0.118, P=0.005). And MO was associated with a higher severity of angiographic CAD than non-MO after adjustment for age and sex (β=0.077, P=0.024). The above associations were also consistent in subjects without DM (MONW, β=0.147, P=0.003 and MO, β=0.129, P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: MONW or MO is associated with both the prevalence and severity of angiographic CAD after adjustment for age and sex and MONW is independently associated with the severity of angiographic CAD irrespective of DM. Therefore, subjects with MO but normal weight (MONW) should be carefully examined for angiographic CAD.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVETo study whether NH2-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a short-term independent predictor of both all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in type 2 diabetic patients and to establish whether albuminuria and C-reactive protein (CRP) affect this relationship.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThe prospective study included 1,825 type 2 diabetic patients from the population-based cohort of the Casale Monferrato study. CV risk factors, preexisting CVD, and NT-proBNP levels were evaluated at baseline. All-cause and CV mortality were assessed 5.5 years after baseline examination. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate mortality hazard ratios (HRs).RESULTSDuring the follow-up period, 390 people died (175 for CVD) out of 9,101 person-years of observations. A significantly increased mortality risk by quartiles of NT-proBNP was observed (test for trend, P < 0.001). NT-proBN P values >91 pg/mL conferred HRs of 2.05 (95% CI 1.47-2.86) for all-cause and 4.47 (2.38-8.39) for CV mortality, independently of CV risk factors, including CRP and albumin excretion rate (AER). The association was also significant for modest rises in NT-proBNP levels and in patients without microalbuminuria and CVD at baseline (upper quartiles HRs 3.82 [95% CI 1.24-13.75]) and 3.14 [1.00-9.94]). Albuminuria and NT-proBNP had an additive effect on mortality, though the association was stronger for NT-proBNP.CONCLUSIONSNT-proBNP is a strong independent predictor of short-term CV mortality risk in elderly people with type 2 diabetes, including those without preexisting CVD. This association is evident even in people with slightly increased values, is not modified by CRP, and is additive to that provided by AER.",

        "input": "In pregnant women, the diabetic condition results in a three- to fivefold increased risk for fetal cardiac malformations as a result of elevated glucose concentrations and the resultant osmotic stress in the developing embryo and fetus. Heart development before septation in the chick embryo was studied under two hyperglycemic conditions. Pulsed hyperglycemia induced by daily administration of glucose during 3 days of development caused daily spikes in plasma glucose concentration. In a second model, sustained hyperglycemia was induced with a single injection of glucose into the yolk on day 0. The sustained model raised the average plasma glucose concentration from 70 mg/dL to 180 mg/dL and led to decreased gene expression of glucose transporter GLUT1. Both models of hyperglycemia reduced embryo size, increased mortality, and delayed development. Within the heart outflow tract, reduced proliferation of myocardial and endocardial cells resulted from the sustained hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity. The cell cycle inhibitor p21 was significantly increased, whereas cyclin D1, a cell cycle promoter, decreased in sustained hyperglycemia compared with controls. The evidence suggests that hyperglycemia-induced developmental delays are associated with slowed cell cycle progression, leading to reduced cellular proliferation. The suppression of critical developmental steps may underlie the cardiac defects observed during late gestation under hyperglycemic conditions.",

In this phase IIb clinical trial, 258 patients with type 2 diabetes completed a 12-week protocol with 50, 100, or 150 mg of MSDC-0160 (an mTOT modulator), 45 mg pioglitazone HCl (a PPAR-γ agonist), or a placebo. The two active treatments lowered fasting glucose levels to the same extent. The decreases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) observed with the two higher doses of MSDC-0160 were not different from those associated with pioglitazone. By contrast, fluid retention as evidenced by reduction in hematocrit, red blood cells, and total hemoglobin was 50% less in the MSDC-0160-treated groups. There was also a smaller increase in high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin with MSDC-0160 than with pioglitazone (P < 0.0001), suggesting that MSDC-0160 produces less expansion of white adipose tissue.

        "input": "Glucocorticoid signaling plays a critical role in regulating energy metabolism. Emerging data implicate environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals as contributors to the obesity and diabetes epidemics. Previous studies have shown that the phenylsulfamide fungicide tolylfluanid (TF) augments glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent luciferase expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes while modulating insulin action in primary murine and human adipocytes. Studies were performed to interrogate glucocorticoid signaling in primary adipocytes exposed to TF. TF mimicked the gene transcription profile of the murine glucocorticoid corticosterone (Cort). Cellular fractionation assays demonstrated that TF treatment promoted the activating serine phosphorylation of GR, augmenting its cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation as well as its enrichment at glucocorticoid response elements on the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper gene promoter. After acute treatment, Cort or TF promoted insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) gene and protein expression. Either treatment also enriched GR binding at an identified glucocorticoid response element in the IRS-1 gene. TF or Cort each increased insulin-stimulated lipogenesis, an effect resulting from increased lipogenic gene expression and enhanced insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase. The augmentation of insulin-stimulated lipogenesis was mediated through a specific enhancement of Akt phosphorylation at T308. These findings support modulation of IRS-1 levels as a mechanism for glucocorticoid-mediated changes in insulin action in primary adipocytes. Albeit with less affinity than Cort, in silico analysis suggests that TF can interact with the ligand binding pocket of GR. Collectively, these studies identify TF as a structurally unique environmental glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoid signaling may thus represent a novel pathway by which environmental toxicants promote the development of metabolic diseases.",

Some inositol isomers have been reported to possess insulin-mimetic activity and to be efficient in lowering blood glucose level.

Mice given myo-inositol treatment (0.9 or 1.2 mg g(-1) day(-1), 15 days, orally or intraperitoneally) exhibited an improved glucose tolerance due to a greater insulin sensitivity. Mice treated with myo-inositol exhibited a decreased white adipose tissue accretion (-33%, P<.005) compared with controls. The decrease in white adipose tissue deposition was due to a decrease in adipose cell volume (-33%, P<.05), while no change was noticed in total adipocyte number. In skeletal muscle, in vivo as well as ex vivo myo-inositol treatment increased protein kinase B/Akt phosphorylation under baseline and insulin-stimulated conditions, suggesting a synergistic action of myo-inositol treatment and insulin on proteins of the insulin signalling pathway.

        "input": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic progressive metabolic disorder that has profound consequences for individuals, families, and society. To date, main available oral antidiabetic medications target either insulin resistance (metformin, glitazones), or insulin deficiency (sulfonylureas, glinides), but leading to shortfalls in medication. Advancement in modern oral hypoglycemic agents may be encouraged with or in place of traditional therapies. The lower risk for hypoglycemic events as compared with other insulinotropic or insulin-sensitizing agents make DPP-4 inhibitors very promising candidates for a more physiological treatment of type-2 diabetes. Only some DPP-4 inhibitors are currently used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and various inhibitors currently undergoing animal and human testing. A number of catalytically active DPPs distinct from DPP-4 (DPP II, FAP, DPP-8, and DPP-9) have been described that is associated with side-effect and toxicity. To discover potent and selective and safer drugs in a shorter time frame and with reduced cost it requires using an innovative approach for designing novel inhibitors. This review article focuses on the status of advanced lead candidates of DPP group and their binding affinity with the active site residue of target structure which help in discovery of potent and selective DPP-4 inhibitors by lead optimization approach.",

A clinical trial was conducted in which 86 subjects presenting with overweight or obesity and prediabetes received a personalized diet of 1,200 to 1,700 calories with a distribution of 50 % carbohydrates, 20 % proteins, and 30 % fat. Body weight, fat mass, and lean mass were measured through bioimpedance. Glucose, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low density cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured. The measurements were taken at the beginning of, and at, 6 and 12 months during the intervention, and the differences were compared by paired Student's t and χ(2) tests. At 12 months, a significant reduction was noticed in body weight in patients with overweight and obesity (72.4 ± 7.8-69.6 ± 7.5 kg) (85.7 ± 14.8-80.2 ± 12.7 kg) with body mass index (28.2 ± 0.8-27.2 ± 2.1 kg/m(2)) (34.3 ± 3.5-32.1 ± 3.2 kg/m(2)), systolic (120.9 ± 14.2-112.4 ± 11.5 mmHg) (124.1 ± 11.9-115.7 ± 14.0 mmHg), diastolic blood pressures (79.0 ± 9.3-71.8 ± 8.3 mmHg) (80.4 ± 9.0-73.7 ± 13.1 mmHg), glucose (106.0 ± 8.9-95.9 ± 7.5 mg/dL) (107.3 ± 7.0-97.0 ± 8.2 mg/dL), and significant improvement on lipid profile (p < 0.05).

        "input": "Besides its role as a carboxylase cofactor, biotin has a wide repertoire of effects on gene expression, development and metabolism. Pharmacological concentrations of biotin enhance insulin secretion and the expression of genes and signaling pathways that favor islet function in vitro. However, the in vivo effects of biotin supplementation on pancreatic islet function are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether in vivo biotin supplementation in the diet has positive effects in rodent pancreatic islets. Male BALB/cAnN Hsd mice were fed a control or a biotin-supplemented diet over 8 weeks postweaning and tested for glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, islet gene expression and pancreatic morphometry. Insulin secretion increased from the islets of biotin-supplemented mice, together with the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of several transcription factors regulating insulin expression and secretion, including forkhead box A2, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α. The mRNA abundance of glucokinase, Cacna1d, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and insulin also increased. Consistent with these effects, glucose tolerance improved, and glucose-stimulated serum insulin levels increased in biotin-supplemented mice, without changes in fasting glucose levels or insulin tolerance. Biotin supplementation augmented the proportion of beta cells by enlarging islet size and, unexpectedly, also increased the percentage of islets with alpha cells at the islet core. mRNA expression of neural cell adhesion molecule 1, an adhesion protein participating in the maintenance of islet architecture, decreased in biotin-supplemented islets. These findings provide, for the first time, insight into how biotin supplementation exerts its effects on function and proportion of beta cells, suggesting a role for biotin in the prevention and treatment of diabetes.",

        "input": "Upon their discovery almost 40 years ago, isoforms of the lipid-activated protein kinase C (PKC) family were initially regarded only as downstream effectors of the second messengers calcium and diacylglycerol, undergoing activation upon phospholipid hydrolysis in response to acute stimuli. Subsequently, several isoforms were found to be associated with the inhibitory effects of lipid over-supply on glucose homeostasis, especially the negative cross-talk with insulin signal transduction, observed upon accumulation of diacylglycerol in insulin target tissues. The PKC family has therefore attracted much attention in diabetes and obesity research, because intracellular lipid accumulation is strongly correlated with defective insulin action and the development of type 2 diabetes. Causal roles for various isoforms in the generation of insulin resistance have more recently been confirmed using PKC-deficient mice. However, during characterization of these animals, it became increasingly evident that the enzymes play key roles in the modulation of lipid metabolism itself, and may control the supply of lipids between tissues such as adipose and liver. Molecular studies have also demonstrated roles for PKC isoforms in several aspects of lipid metabolism, such as adipocyte differentiation and hepatic lipogenesis. While the precise mechanisms involved, especially the identities of protein substrates, are still unclear, the emerging picture suggests that the currently held view of the contribution of PKC isoforms to metabolism is an over-simplification. Although PKCs may inhibit insulin signal transduction, these enzymes are not merely downstream effectors of lipid accumulation, but in fact control the fate of fatty acids, thus the tail wags the dog.",

        "input": "Net hepatic glucose uptake (NHGU) is an important contributor to postprandial glycemic control. We hypothesized that NHGU is reduced during normal pregnancy and in a pregnant diet-induced model of impaired glucose intolerance/gestational diabetes mellitus (IGT/GDM). Dogs (n = 7 per group) that were nonpregnant (N), normal pregnant (P), or pregnant with IGT/GDM (pregnant dogs fed a high-fat and -fructose diet [P-HFF]) underwent a hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic clamp with intraportal glucose infusion. Clamp period insulin, glucagon, and glucose concentrations and hepatic glucose loads did not differ among groups. The N dogs reached near-maximal NHGU rates within 30 min; mean ± SEM NHGU was 105 ± 9 µmol·100 g liver⁻¹·min⁻¹. The P and P-HFF dogs reached maximal NHGU in 90-120 min; their NHGU was blunted (68 ± 9 and 16 ± 17 µmol·100 g liver⁻¹·min⁻¹, respectively). Hepatic glycogen synthesis was reduced 20% in P versus N and 40% in P-HFF versus P dogs. This was associated with a reduction (>70%) in glycogen synthase activity in P-HFF versus P and increased glycogen phosphorylase (GP) activity in both P (1.7-fold greater than N) and P-HFF (1.8-fold greater than P) dogs. Thus, NHGU under conditions mimicking the postprandial state is delayed and suppressed in normal pregnancy, with concomitant reduction in glycogen storage. NHGU is further blunted in IGT/GDM. This likely contributes to postprandial hyperglycemia during pregnancy, with potential adverse outcomes for the fetus and mother.",

        "input": "β-Cell failure coupled with insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. Changes in circulating levels of adipokines, factors released from adipose tissue, form a significant link between excessive adiposity in obesity and both aforementioned factors. In this review, we consider the published evidence for the role of individual adipokines on the function, proliferation, death and failure of β-cells, focusing on those reported to have the most significant effects (leptin, adiponectin, tumour necrosis factor α, resistin, visfatin, dipeptidyl peptidase IV and apelin). It is apparent that some adipokines have beneficial effects whereas others have detrimental properties; the overall contribution to β-cell failure of changed concentrations of adipokines in the blood of obese pre-diabetic subjects will be highly dependent on the balance between these effects and the interactions between the adipokines, which act on the β-cell via a number of intersecting intracellular signalling pathways. We emphasise the importance, and comparative dearth, of studies into the combined effects of adipokines on β-cells.",

Aqueous extracts were prepared (1:100 w/v) and the supernatant used for the analysis. The extracts caused inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities in vitro.The IC(50) revealed that the red variety (25.2 μg/mL) exhibited higher α-glucosidase inhibitory activity than the white variety (47.4 μg/mL), while the white variety (90.5 μg/mL) exhibited higher α-amylase inhibitory activity than the red variety (187.9 μg/mL). However, the α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of both calyces were higher than that of their α-amylase. In addition, the red variety possessed higher antioxidant capacity as exemplified by the (•)OH scavenging abilities, Fe(2+) chelating ability, and inhibition of Fe(2+)-induced pancreatic lipid peroxidation in vitro. The enzyme inhibitory activities and antioxidant properties of the roselle extracts agreed with their phenolic content. Hence, inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase, coupled with strong antioxidant properties could be the possible underlying mechanism for the antidiabetes properties of H. sabdariffa calyces; however, the red variety appeared to be more potent.",

Both MATE genotypes were associated with altered post-metformin glucose tolerance, with variant carriers of MATE1 and MATE2 having an enhanced (P < 0.01) and reduced (P < 0.05) response, respectively. Consistent with these results, patients with diabetes (n = 145) carrying the MATE1 variant showed enhanced metformin response.

The identity and function of the causal genes in these susceptibility loci remain, however, elusive. The HHEX/IDE T2D locus is associated with decreased insulin secretion in response to oral glucose stimulation in humans. Here we have assessed β-cell function in Ide knock-out (KO) mice. We find that glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is decreased in Ide KO mice due to impaired replenishment of the releasable pool of granules and that the Ide gene is haploinsufficient. We also show that autophagic flux and microtubule content is reduced in β-cells of Ide KO mice. One important cellular role for IDE involves the neutralization of amyloidogenic proteins and we find that α-synuclein and IDE levels are inversely correlated in β-cells of Ide KO mice and T2D patients. Moreover, we provide evidence that both gain- and loss-of-function of α-synuclein in β-cells in vivo not only impair GSIS but also autophagy. Together, these data identify the Ide gene as a regulator of GSIS, suggest a molecular mechanism for β-cell degeneration as a consequence of Ide deficiency, and additionally corroborates and extends a previously established important role for α-synuclein in β-cell function.",

We assessed obesity-induced changes of n-3-derived SPM in adipose tissue and effects of dietary EPA/DHA thereon.Moreover, we treated obese mice with SPM precursors and investigated effects on inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. Obesity significantly decreased DHA-derived 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHA, resolvin D1 precursor) and protectin D1 levels in murine adipose tissue. Dietary EPA/DHA treatment restored endogenous biosynthesis of n-3 derived lipid mediators in obesity while attenuating adipose tissue inflammation and improving insulin sensitivity. Notably, 17-HDHA treatment reduced adipose tissue expression of inflammatory cytokines, increased adiponectin expression and improved glucose tolerance parallel to insulin sensitivity in obese mice.

Male C57BL/6 mice (n=30) were randomly divided into 3 dietary groups consisting of either standard rodent chow (4.8 % fat, 20 % protein), or a high fat (HF) diet (21-23 % fat, 19 % protein) with low GI (15.4 % starch; HF-LG) or high GI (50.5 % dextrose; HF-HG) ad libitum for 10 weeks. Body weight, blood glucose, glucose tolerance, and circulating cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured for the duration of the study. We found that increasing the GI of a moderately HF diet induces severe hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance in C57BL/6 mice, reflective of criteria for diagnosis of T2D, whilst littermates consuming an equivalent low GI diet maintain glucose homeostasis.

The abilities of 10 X. strumarium-derived components to counteract diabetic complications were investigated by means of inhibitory assays with rat lens AR (rAR) and recombinant human AR (rhAR). From the 10 isolated compounds, methyl-3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinate showed the most potent inhibition, with IC50 values of 0.30 and 0.67 μM for rAR and rhAR, respectively. In the kinetic analyses using Lineweaver-Burk plots of 1/velocity and 1/substrate, methyl-3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinate showed competitive inhibition of rhAR. Furthermore, methyl-3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinate inhibited galactitol formation in the rat lens and in erythrocytes incubated with a high concentration of glucose, indicating that this compound may be effective in preventing diabetic complications.",

Therefore, this enzyme constitutes a highly attractive therapeutic target for the development of selective inhibitors as new promising drugs for the treatment of these pathologies. We describe here the isolation and biochemical characterization of the marine natural sesquiterpene palinurin as a GSK-3β inhibitor. Experimental studies performed for characterizing the inhibitory mechanism indicate that GSK-3β inhibition by palinurin cannot be competed out by ATP nor peptide substrate. Molecular modelling techniques have enabled us to propose an unconventional binding mode to GSK-3β. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations have identified an allosteric mechanism by which binding of palinurin leads to GSK-3β inhibition. The inhibitory activities determined for a series of structurally related analogues support the proposed binding mode of palinurin, which is the first compound described to target this allosteric site. The results offer new opportunities for designing and developing selective inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action.",
