        "input": "Hi doctor, I had a C-section eight years ago with my son and a C-section seven months back with my daughter. I am interested in having another child and wanted to plan on coming off of birth control till mid of this year. My doctor said that, in general, they prefer women to have two years between deliveries. My question is, when will my uterus get completely healed and ready to handle the pressure of another pregnancy? If I get pregnant sooner than later, I would be a few months less of the two-year mark.",
        "output": "Hi, Welcome to iclinq.com. Generally, by book, it needs 18 months for your uterus to heal from the previous cesarean cut, but healing is regulated by many factors like intrinsic tissue quality, general nutritional status of the lady, the healing power of the body, diabetes, postoperative convalescence, sepsis, the presence of protein diet, etc. Since you had another C-section, did the doctor mention the difficulty of the cesarean section at that time? Did your first and second cesarean go well or was associated with greater care than general? Since the healing is dependent on a lot of things, and also the uterus can never come back to its original strength due to two scars on the body, so the two-year safety mark. So, if you wish to take the pregnancy sooner, you should be compliant in visiting a doctor in a tertiary care center, with an emergency OT and blood bank facility.",

The doctor he visited gave him medicines for his boil and said the boil will come out in some days. The swelling in his foot has increased and so he visited the same doctor the next day and was advised to see an orthopedic. The orthopedic doctor did not diagnose it but referred him to a general doctor who again did not diagnose it but said there is pus buildup inside the foot and it needs surgery. My father who accompanied my brother asked the doctor whether it will subside with medicines or if surgery is needed. The doctor simply said you can use the medicine or you can do the surgery. I am out of the country and feel the doctor may have not specified the situation correctly to my father and also may have not clearly explained why he suggested the surgery. I needed a second opinion, as I want my brother to receive proper treatment and identify if it is a serious condition and I need to know the best solution.

I see some amount of inter arytenoid pachydermia (suggestive of acid reflux and associated changes in the posterior part of vocal apparatus) and anterior phonatory gap. Although I cannot see the anterior one-third of the vocal cords that clearly, I understand that your ENT has found that those portions had some hemorrhages. He was right in advising you voice rest and proton pump inhibitors. Ideally, a week of absolute voice rest is sufficient. Followed by voice restriction, vocal hygiene, antiallergic treatment, nasal sprays (based on nasal symptoms), increased hydration, etc. Now considering you have taken a month of voice rest, I think it is sufficient. But do you have any symptoms whatsoever now? Any nasal symptoms or allergic symptoms? Any history of substance abuse? Do you suffer from diabetes or hypertension? In my practice in addition to antireflux (PPI tablets), antiallergics (antihistaminics like Fexofenadine, Allegra, Deslor, etc), hydration, voice rest, dietary and lifestyle changes. I add some voice therapy. Probably you should explore some vocal hygiene tips from a speech-language pathologist or voice therapist.",

How to tell my mom without making her worry.",
        "output": "Hello. I understand you are quite worried and frightened about your problems. Social anxiety is common, and it is all about what it does that affects the people more. Your worries about your inability to hold on to a job and avoiding social situations are valid. It is very important to treat social anxiety because if left untreated it will gradually keep increasing and you may end up feeling frustrated and depressed as well. Regarding explaining this to your mother, you can read and find it easy to understand articles regarding social anxiety and ask your mother to go through that. First of all, you need to make her understand that it is an illness like diabetes or hypertension. If it is an illness, it has some symptoms and a proper course and treatment as well. If you had diabetes, would your mother pity you? No, she would ask you to consult a doctor. Similarly, in this case, you will need medicines as well as therapy to overcome your symptoms and gain some control of your life. No one needs to pity you for anything. Once you start viewing this from a rational point of view, you will be able to explain it better to your family. I hope this helps. Take care.",

Since it is not itchy or painful you should not worry about it and you should not use Cortisone cream as it makes things worse. Keep good hygiene area should be dry and clean. Use nonchemical lubricant like olive oil if you masturbate. If you have changed your soap or shower gel it might be the cause. Take vitamin E and vitamin A to replace your vitamin deficiency. If you are known to have psoriasis then treatment can be by Methoteraxate cream (but only for people who are known to have psoriasis).

Physical changes like increased body fat and reduced muscle mass or bulk. Sexual changes like reduced sexual desire, sexual dysfunction, or infertility. Emotional changes like decreased motivation, depression, lethargic. Worsening of sleep apnea if a patient already has it or if there are risk factors the patient will get sleep apnea possibly. Worsening of congestive heart failure in cardiac patients. Many of your symptoms overlap with low-T. You need further probing in this matter. Your treating physician would help you in this regard.

        "output": "Hello. You have bilateral renal pelvic obstruction due to stones with diabetes with urinary tract infection. The pain in the groin is due to pelvic renal calculi, the pain of which radiates to the groin.

Otherwise, your infection does not get resolved as the pus is due to disease associated with stones. Your stomach upset and pain in the abdomen is due to Nitrofurantoin, which causes gastritis and acidity. Nitrofurantoin is not the right choice for treating such infection. It can be useful as maintenance therapy. Kindly get diabetes treated. Please check serum creatinine checked once you start injection Amikacin.

I just finished my second course and I am still in pain, with lump still the size of a small grape, and still feel ill and feel like I am getting worse again. Breast is back to being red and swollen. My only option to see a medical professional before my breast screening is to wait for several hours at an urgent care clinic after work. Should I try and get more antibiotics?

The past three months I suffered from several weird conditions. Ringing in the ears, while the tones shift in frequency (I guess this is not an usual aspect of tinnitus), sometime seeing stars or flashes and headaches. I decided to make a new MRI of my brain, to make sure everything is normal. The new MRI shows some differences compared to the one made earlier. I was pretty shocked when I saw the images. In regard of a second opinion, I would like some more information about abnormalities found in the recent MRI, just to get as much information as possible about my brains health. I would like to ask you a few questions regarding the images from my latest MRI. 1. Could you give your opinion about the images and possible abnormalities? 2. Could you explain about the cortexes where the possible abnormalities are in? 3. Is the area around my mouth or sinuses in the recent MRI looking normal? 4. What is the bright spot in picture 13a? 5.

Do you notice anything strange around the mouth area?",
        "output": "Hello.  After having gone through the images, my first message to you is: Nothing to worry (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Absolutely nothing to worry or simply think about. Just wash them out of your mind. All you need to do is lead a healthy life with healthy habits. My findings in your recent MRI: Prominent cisterna magna aka mega cisterna magna, tiny T2-bright spot in the right lentiform nucleus, likely representing an old tiny infarct. Retention cyst in right maxillary sinus. None of these findings have any clinical significance, nor do they have any significant effect on your living or longevity. The old tiny infarct is tiny enough that you never knew that it was there. However, if it were larger, it could have troubled your living, so it is something to remain conscious about. Mega cisterna magna (enlarged CSF space behind cerebellum) occurs in <1% of people and is mostly considered a harmless normal variant. However, people with MCM are often considered to be prone to infarcts, so it would be advisable that you avoid or control other factors that also cause infarcts, especially when there is already an infarct (thankfully tiny, though) like controlling hypertension / diabetes (if you have), avoiding smoking and alcohol, etc. Retention cyst is a fluid-containing pouch that can develop in the nasal sinuses. It is harmless, in fact not worth mentioning. Your mouth and sinuses do look normal, except for the retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. Unfortunately, none of your files is labeled 13A. However, there is a bright spot - it is the retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. The bright line is an artifact generated by the machine during imaging or image processing. Regarding your worries over familial cancer, there is nothing your brain MRI to increase your worries. Perhaps regular follow-up is sufficient. I asked about dental implants because without the DICOM images, I was a bit confused whether the bright spot (representing the retention cyst) was in the sinus or in the gums or teeth. Now, I am confirmed that it is in the sinus and your teeth sockets are normal.",

In your situation, I feel it is autoimmune condition most probably diffuse alopecia areata, because you have been diagnosed with Hashimoto's and ankylosing spondylitis. I do not know if you have taken an injection of corticosteroids (Triamcinolone) for the scalp. This is very helpful in an autoimmune condition. I am considering the most probable cause, and it could even be female pattern alopecia. Do you have a family history of baldness, history of surgery, illness, stressful events before you noticed hair loss? Please send the pictures of the scalp.",

        "output": "Hello. Premature ejaculation is defined as ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation, before the patient desires and before or within one minute of penetration. Frequently, performance anxiety could be a cause of premature ejaculation. In that case, you can take deep breathing for two minutes before sex. It will relax you enough. If you still feel anxious, you can take tablet Alprazolam 0.5mg half an hour before sexual activity. Remind yourself that you are having sex for mutual pleasure and relaxation. It is not an ordeal or duty where you are supposed to be the performer. There are many ways to treat premature ejaculation if it is not possibly due to anxiety. 1) The first technique is known as squeeze technique. In it, when you reach close to orgasm, you or your partner should squeeze on the ridge between the glans and the shaft of penis till the erection subsides. Then begin with your sexual activity once again. Repeat this a few times before you finally ejaculate. This will increase your time of ejaculation and also give you some voluntary control. 2) The second option is you can use Lignocaine spray (Shotmax spray). Spray once on the glans penis 15 minutes before sexual activity. It will reduce the extra sensitivity of the glans to normal level. You can also use 2% Lignox jelly (Lignocaine) instead of spray. 3) The third option is you can take tablet Dapoxetine 30 mg one hour before sexual activity. These techniques are sufficient to treat majority cases of premature ejaculation. 1. Anxiety. 2. Sensitive glans. Premature ejaculation. 1. Treat performance anxiety.  2. Squeeze technique. 3.

ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) doesn't need to be always increased when CRP raised because ESR is a non-specific marker of inflammation. It is not as much sense as like that of CRP. Your CRP value mildly increased which will fall within range once inflammation resolution occurs. Allergic rhinitis probably might be the cause. The irritable bowel syndrome and tension headache are associated with anxiety. So you need to treat anxiety with anxiolytic medicine and with SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) group of drug for few months along with counseling. For anxiety treatment, you can visit a nearby psychiatrist. I hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.",

I am attaching my scan reports here for your reference.",
        "output": "Hi. You are suffering from PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), which is found in 5-10 percentage of general population and there is nothing to worry for it. Your spotting is not related to PCOS directly. In PCOS, periods become irregular due to anovulation, which leads to heavy bleeding due to unopposed estrogen in body. Simple treatment for it is to take combined oral contraceptive pills for regularizing periods before marriage and when you are not trying for pregnancy. It will also prevent ill effects of unopposed estrogen on endometrium. Another option is to induce regular withdrawal by taking Progesterone tablets (Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg twice daily for 5 days) to induce menses every 30-45 days. Spotting should stop once you start oral contraceptive pills, which you can start right now if you are not trying for pregnancy. To prevent long-term ill effects of PCOS, you need to take healthy diet (low carbohydrate, fat, refined sugars and high in fiber content). Do regular exercise for at least 30-45 minutes daily and induce period by oral contraceptive pill and Progesterone tablets regularly. You should avoid gaining weight at all costs as it may impair glucose tolerance and precipitate diabetes in later life. I hope you are taking Iron and vitamin D3 supplements to recover from deficiency.

It happens quite frequently in patients taking it (about 13 percent of the patients to be precise). But I would suggest you not to stop the drug until the breathlessness is quite severe because it is very important to keep the blood thin and the stent open. So he should continue taking Brilinta. Another reason for breathlessness can be decreased ejection fraction, pumping of his heart, water getting accumulated in the chest and hence the breathlessness. And to make sure that this is not the cause I want you to answer my few questions. Is he having any swelling in the feet? Is he having difficulty breathing when he lies down? Does he have a cough? If the answers to any of these questions are yes and to prevent the water from accumulating in the lungs you can add a diuretic which will make him do more urine and get the water out of the lungs. But to confirm it as soon as the COVID situation settles down, you can get an appointment with your doctor for a echocardiography and get it done. For numbness, it can be usually a sign of a neuropathy either due to nutrient deficiency or any metabolic disease. I would prescribe you a few drugs. Does he a have history of diabetes mellitus? Brilinta induces dyspnea. LV dysfunction. ECG. 2D echo. LV dysfunction. Brilinta induced dyspnea. Brilinta induced dyspnea. Tablet Torsemide 5 mg 1-0-0, Neurobion 0-1-0.

While masturbating, on the third day,Â IÂ got pain in my penis, and it was in the middle of the shaft of the penis at the thumb point. I visited the doctor again, and he prescribed Polycovit, Mynubin-P, Zanocin 300, TrentalÂ 400 mg and I also masturbated four times a week. But still, the pain continued. So, I wentÂ through the test again eight months back. The value of PSV was 25 cm/s and EDV was 0, but the inner caversonal diameter changed to .44 mm pre-injection and after. The third time I underwent the test again. The values were normal at 25 cm/s, and EDV at 0, and the inner diameter was .6 mm and after injection at 1.2 mm. I still have the pain in the penis at the same point. It has now been a year since the pain has started. There is no bending duringÂ erection, but there is a deformation in the penis like an hourglass shape and hard flaccid. Now, I masturbate only once aÂ week. Is the 25 cm/s good or does it mean an arterial insufficiency? Does Peyronie's disease obstruct the blood flow in the penile doppler? I have no diabetes, no cholesterol, andÂ I am not a smoker.

        "output": "Hello. Regarding the treatment, I suggest you continue the medicines as they are. I would like to know how much of Prednisolone did you start with? Nextly, you must start on intranasal steroids to help relieve the nasal symptoms. Use Fluticasone furoate twice daily two puffs in each nostril twice daily. The brands available in the Philippines are Avamys, Flutiair, Nasoflo, Flusort. If you feel the antihistaminics are making you drowsy, then you may keep the Cetirizine for the evening and take Loratidine in the morning. Apply a mild steroid cream like Betamethasone valerate 0.1% topical cream over the affected skin. The brands available in your country are Diprolene, Diprosone, and Betnovate. Long term solution: You must do a skin prick testing to check what you are allergic to. Skin prick testing is better than blood allergy testing. Both the methods check for food and aeroallergens. Remember that before the testing you should stop the antihistaminics for five days. With such a test we will come to know the offending agent and give you the right advice to prevent that particular allergen. Do revert back for more details.

For growths already spread beyond the bladder, chemotherapy may be needed. No point in delaying the treatment. Also, there is no need to panic. Consult a urologist in person who deals with urological cancers and get your father evaluated.

After a while, her leg started swelling, and slowly the blood platelet count came to 28000. She got admitted to the hospital and was on Xone antibiotics and Dolo 650 with trips. Leg swelling slowly reduced and the platelet count reached 125000. Four months before, she had a leg swelling and it got cured after taking some medicines prescribed by a doctor. Basic creatinine, dengue, blood test, and scan were done. Light swelling in the liver and spleen is seen. Dengue and other basic reports showed negative. Today we received a report positive (ANA), Pattern: Nuclear fine granular (strongly positive). This may be associated with SJS, SLE, neonatal LE, Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, progressive systemic sclerosis. Can you please advise.",

        "output": "Hi. Many patients come to me with this complaint of frequent sore throat. First I would say do not worry about this. We must evaluate if there is any pathogenic organism residing in the throat and causing recurrent infections. For the same a throat swab (culture and sensitivity) test is required based on which we can proceed further treatment. If tonsils are the foci of infection they frequently enlarge and cause obstructive symptoms like difficulty in swallowing, pain while swallowing and also bad smell from mouth. A physical examination by an otolaryngologist can easily diagnose tonsillar enlargement. Rather you can send me a selfie with open mouth taking care the back of throat is visible and tongue does not obstruct the view. Frequently the condition can be allergic when it does not result in pain and pus but causes frequent itching, throat discomfort and nasal discharge and sneezing. On the inflamed mucosa secondarily bacteria can multiply and produce an infection. Throat infection can cause pain and infection in the ear due to continuity with ear through the eustachian tube. Eustachian tube which serves to maintain equal pressure on both sides of eardrum and drain ear secretions can result in ear pain and fullness when blocked. As general precautions in addition to salt water gargles, take steam inhalation also. During throat pain, use Chlorhexidine gargles. Mix 5 mL Chlorhexidine in plain water and gargle the throat and spit out the fluid. Also let us know if you have any additional symptoms like cough, vomiting, fever, headache, giddiness, etc., which can help us to make more decisive diagnosis. Also let us know about your habits and please mention any medication you are taking for diabetes or hypertension, etc. 1. Throat swab. 2. Total blood count. 1. Allergic rhinopharyngitis. 2.

Do daily exercise for 30 to 40 minutes, do meditation for 15 minutes, do what you like for 20 minutes like give time for your hobbies, read good books, painting, write journals, take good healthy foods, avoid junk food, get sound sleep for seven to eight hours, spend quality time with family and friends. Live life. Find a reason to live. Being jobless is not the end of life. Do something new. Start your new life.

        "input": "Hello doctor, This query is for my dad who is 75 years. In the last two months, one week he has been housebound and the initial one month, he was completely bedridden. He slipped twice on the first day. That is how it all started. His right leg could not carry the weight of his body. He is approx 110 kg, 6 feet tall. He has had this problem for the last 30 years but he had never been bedridden and the medication worked. He is also diabetic, taking medication for the heart - Eliquis 2.5 mg to reduce the risk of formation of blood clots and he also has varicose veins. On the first day after this started, he took medication himself as per his last prescription. It did not work and after four days, we called the same doctor home who prescribed Insulin, Zocef CV 500 twice 10 days, Levoflox 500 one a day for 10 days and Daflon twice for 15 days. He said to give it nine days before a follow-up. However, after five days since there was no relief and it had started oozing or edema which he noticed when he was sitting up when two visitors came over. The next day, we called another doctor, a diabetologist, as the previous doctor, then said to visit a vascular surgeon as he could not do anything about the oozing. This doctor completely changed the medicines prescribing Linospan 600 twice, Ceftum 500 twice, Chymoral Forte twice along with two other ointments Nadoxin and Betadine and dressing the wounds. This gave immediate relief. He continued the medication for two weeks till the next follow by the same doctor. By this time, the wounds (characterized by oozing, discoloration, swelling) had completely healed except a small hole at the ankle. This time, the doctor prescribed Doxy 100 twice for two weeks and Orni O twice for seven days along with the same ointments. After the end of two weeks, he continued this for a further 10 days after which he was prescribed Dalacin 300 mg for seven days. He took this for around 12 days. Since the last 10 days, he has been taking his own medication - Zocef CV 500, Levoflox 500 and Daflon and at present, he is back to Dalacin 300 since the last two days. He is averse to being admitted to a hospital for the fear of amputation and because he does not want to be admitted to a hospital. He prefers to be treated at home. 10 days ago, my mom also went to our family doctor, who on seeing the pics of the leg said that as per his opinion it required immediate hospitalization and recommended a color doppler of both lower limbs both arterial and venous. My dad cannot walk to get this test done. Please advice. Especially since he is not able to walk beyond the bed to the dining table and for not more than five minutes. Also, particularly why does the leg get swollen off and on now? After taking the antibiotics for so long (now 67 days), does it mean that there is some internal problem? How can it be diagnosed?",
        "output": "Hello. He needs to be seen by a podiatric surgeon, or a surgeon who deals with foot care.  Being an elderly diabetic with limb swelling, it is always safe to get a Doppler (both arterial and venous) of the limbs done. Arterial doppler rules out any block or reduced flow and possibility of pre-gangrene (evolving tissue loss). Venous Doppler rules out varicose veins (which he already has) and also deep vein thrombosis (obstruction of deep veins which is dangerous). This can change the current line of management. Antibiotics can be stopped if there is no evidence of active infection and proper limb care is given. Some general measures you have to follow: You can add some flow modulators like Trental (Pentoxifylline 400 mg twice daily) which can improve blood flow. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent.

It starts with inflammation and pain but will stabilize and become painless with time over approximately six months.

Diagnosis is made purely on clinical grounds by history examination and pictures. Treatment ranges from medications to local injections to surgery which is reserved for significant deformity and curvature. I would be grateful to further diagnose and follow up on you.

        "input": "Hello doctor, I am a 60-year-old non-diabetic woman. I am married with a daughter. I had a hysterectomy operation. I am hypertensive and was on Asomex 2.5 mg for the last three years. But taking Asomex 2.5 mg, my BP level fluctuated and sometimes it even increased to about 170/90. I am unable to take Asomex 5 mg as it leads to swelling of my legs and frequent urination. I am on service so on telling my doctor he reduced the dosage to Asomex 2.5 mg. Two months back, I was having a little discomfort and even experiencing pain on the left side of my chest. On monitoring, my BP at my Omron digital BP machine my BP came out to be 180/102. So on the next day, I immediately consulted a general physician and he prescribed me two drugs. Olmezest CH 40 to be taken in the morning and Asomex 2.5 mg to be taken at night or Asomex 1.25 mg if the BP goes below 120/80. I started taking these two drugs from the next day and even regularly monitored my BP using Omron digital BP machine. After 20 days of regularly taking these drugs my BP came down to 123/78, so I took Olmezest CH 40 in the morning and Asomex 1.25 at night and continued this medication for one month. A week ago I was feeling quite weak and on monitoring my BP I saw my BP came down to 90/60. So, now I have stopped taking Olmezest CH40 for the last six days and now I am only taking Asomex 2.5 mg. Today in the morning my BP was 118/70 and my pulse level was 73. Is it safe to stop Olmezest CH 40 like this? What hypertensive drugs can I take and in what dose to stop my BP level fluctuating in this manner?",
        "output": "Hello. You may stop Olmezest if BP falls. You will likely need another antihypertensive along with Asomex 2.5 which is not enough for you and we will not be able to increase it due to side effects. Olmezest takes some time for its full action so when it achieves its full action, it leads to hypotension. So, you will likely need 20 mg of plain Olmezest instead of Olmezest CH 40 which contains two antihypertensives. So, in my opinion, you should continue to monitor your BP regularly, ideally thrice a day for one to two weeks till medicine dosage are optimized. And as soon BP starts rising above 135 to 140 systolic, you should start plain Olmezest 20 mg once a day in the morning. This will help in preventing the future episode of accelerated hypertension. Also, continue with a low salt diet, regular exercises. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.",

        "input": "Hello doctor, I am a 61 year old man and in reasonably good health apart from being overweight and diagnosed diabetic 10 years ago. The following has started after I lost a lot of weight. For the last 9 months, I have had to sleep sitting up in a chair and leaning to my left side. If I lie down to sleep horizontally, or remain sitting up but tilting even slightly backward, or if I slip down on to my back on the chair while asleep, my heart begins to get faster and faster. I feel no pain and it does not wake me up. That is the problem, I sleep through it until I wake up with the need of going to the bathroom. I suspect these episodes last for hours with my heart going dangerously fast. These are not palpitations. When I wake up, my heart is often racing, and I have to take deep breaths for a couple of minutes to get enough oxygen inside me for the heart to return to its normal beat. It all started very suddenly, not progressive. For all these months I have been scared by the prospect of having to go to sleep and leave it as long as possible before trying, just praying that I can get through the night keeping myself upright and with a reasonably clear nose. If I can do that, I can usually make it through reasonably fine, but this is the exception rather than the rule. Body position seems to be one key factor, clear nose another, but the first always overrides the latter in importance. I recently had to make a 6 day 1500 mile dash drive and slept every night upright in the car seat right next to an open window. I had no problems at all during those 5 nights. A cardiologist has run tests and told me there is nothing abnormal with my heartâs muscle or function. I rented an automatic CPAP machine for 4 months, but have now returned it. It does not do much of help, but its data shows no continuous waking such as might happen with obstructive sleep apnea. It does, however, show that I go into periods of shallow breathing while asleep. The only other suggestion that I have had is that this might be some form of central sleep apnea and therefore perhaps more neurologically based. The company that rented me the CPAP machine say that a BIPAP machine might be better, as it will force me to breathe, but I would really like a more expert opinion before going down that extremely expensive road. Do you know any other people who have had similar symptoms and experiences, and if so, what was the cause and how was it treated? Current daily medications I take are 75 mg Aspirin for blood thinning, 1 x 15 mg Pioglitazone/ 850mg Metformin tablet for controlling diabetes, 5 mg Ramipril for blood pressure, and various vitamin and fish oil supplements.",

My kidney, liver functions were great. The EKG came back as within normal limits but there was one mark that had flipped since the last time she saw me. She said it is the lead that goes on the breast so sometimes it reads wrong because of breast tissue. This is on the breast that I had a lumpectomy on. She tried it again and it was a little flatter but still there. So I have to get an echocardiogram and treadmill test.  And she is signing me up for a calcium test. She said if I was not moving to another city next week she would wait until my next appointment in 6 months to see if that line is still there but since I am moving next week and do not have a doctor up there yet she will do the tests here. I have a history of high BP, diabetes, breast cancer and PES in both lungs. My cardiologist said that the flip was on one mark not the whole EKG. Should I be concerned about blockage?",

In fact, his condition has only worsened since the start of the treatment. For the last several days, he has been complaining of erectile dysfunction, urinary hesitancy, drooping of the lip to one side during smiling, occasional numbness in extremities, etc. He has significant loss of memory (only short term) and behavioral problems. He asked me if he should be further investigated to rule out organic disease if any. So, I advised him am MRI (myself an MBBS doctor). MRI showed multiple hyperintense lesions in bilateral frontal lobes, parietal lobes and these changes were attributed to chronic ischemia by the radiologist. Now, I am concerned if his condition is merely a psychiatric disorder or a result of some organic disease. He was never investigated earlier, and all this time he was put on SSRIs and benzodiazepines for OCD. Kindly do help me regarding the same and guide me for the next step in his workup. His current medicines are tablet Fludac twice daily and tablet ClonafitÂ 0.5 mg thrice daily.",

Although the most common causes are diabetes and high blood pressure, consistent hypotension (low blood pressure) can be another reason for ischemic changes.

However, for the past 6 months, my symptoms and use of the medicines has diminished to the point I have not had to take the DDAVP for six months. Etiology unknown as to why I developed DI. Have you ever experienced a person going into remission with DI? Or should I be concerned as I have been having some facial numbs and arm numbness and sometime my equilibrium seems of?",
        "output": "Hello.  It is rare but yes it is possible that over a long period of time, diabetes inspidus can auto correct itself. Over time some, ADH nerve terminals are able to form at the base of the hypothalamus, resulting in the resolution of DI symptoms and the development of an ectopic posterior pituitary. In your case that might be happening and it is a good thing. DI over a period of time is known to cause muscle weakness, and can lead to nerve disorders. I will recommend you to consult a neurologist for your facial numbness, he can perform some tests on you to get the correct picture. Meanwhile you should take a Multivitamin supplement which has Methyl cobalamin and Folic acid (tablet Neurobion Forte once daily for around a month) and check if there is any improvement in your symptoms. It helps in nerve conduction, so might be helpful in your case. Regarding the spontaneous emission, we have to wait and watch.

During daytime, I also get uneasiness and shivering for hours after an episode of heart trembling.Â My BP after this feeling was aÂ little bit high at 180/85 mmHg and then it came down to 135/85 mmHg.Â I went to aÂ neurologist and took CT scan and Doppler of the neck to find for any blocks.Â Both the scans were normal. The doctorÂ prescribed Rancil, a beta blocker 50 mg, Aspirin, sleeping pill 0.25 mg and Vertin.Â I hear some sounds in ears. I also had ear pain and giddiness due to ear fluid. The doctor told that such trembling feeling may be due to ear fluid imbalance or may be due to little blocks in blood vessels, which may not be seen in the CT scan. After I took the medicine for six to seven days, there was no such feeling. For the last three days, I stopped medicine, which was prescribed for 15 days.Â Yesterday night, I felt the same trembling at heart and the sleep was disturbed.Â Then, I took only beta blocker 25 mg (half of the original prescription), Aspirin and sleep pill and I had a good sleep.Â I am not a diabetic and have no BP so far. TheÂ BP in the last three to four days was normal at 125/80 mmHg even thoughÂ I did not take the medicines.Â I walk for one hour on a daily basis regularly. I am also experiencing fainting like feeling, lack of concentration, losing of a sharp and normal vision sometimes. It takes about two to three hours to recover from these symptoms. WhenÂ I take aÂ beta blocker, AspirinÂ andÂ sleep pills I find myself feeling better, but the BP gets lowered to about 95/60 mmHg. For the last two decades, I had vertigo. I used to get it once in every 12 to 15 months and IÂ had got used to it. It normally go away in 15 to 20 days.Â But this time, in the last one month I doubt this is vertigo though I hear some ear sounds and have aÂ little pain in the ears. Though I drive car and two-wheeler slowly, the feeling and unsteadiness makes me very uneasy. During night, sometimes I suddenly wake up after some vibration from the stomach and the chest portion and hence, sleep will be disturbed. I experienced trembling, three times in one month during daytime and felt uneasy in the hands and legs for five hours after that. In the morning, unsteadiness starts to occur and it has happened five times in one month. I am not able to concentrate and there is a fearful sensationÂ in the body. This problem needs to be treated. I doubt whether taking Metoprolol and Rancil will lower the blood pressure. For the past 10 days, I am taking Metoprolol 50 mg, RancilÂ 20 mg at night, Aspirin at night, Vertin at night, sleep pill 0.25 mg at night and Pan 40 in the morning. Earlier, I was taking Vertin.

It not only about bringing sugar levels down, also it should not cause any nutritional deficiency, which may happen with paleo. Having higher intake of animal foods means having higher and processed saturated fats. For diabetes, all carbs are not the culprit, only simple and processed form of carbs raise blood glucose levels. For sustainable lowering of blood glucose, one should have a large serving of fruits pre-breakfast (fruits do not increase blood glucose), a large serving of mixed salads before lunch and dinner. Reduce intake of rice and wheat based foods. Totally avoid market and packed foods, dairy in all forms, refined oils. With these changes, you can have sustained lower blood glucose.

        "input": "Hi doctor, I have been taking Protonix for almost three weeks for acid reflux. I had some blood laboratory work done and it showed my AST 812 and ALT 1,115. Could this be a rare side effect of Protonix? My glucose also went up to 192 and lipase is 72. I do not drink, smoke or use drugs. My doctor ran more tests the next day, but has not gotten the results yet. So, he has not prescribed anything yet for my sugar levels. She knows that I have not been feeling well for the past three weeks. I just stopped taking Protonix from yesterday. Also, I discontinued my regular Plaquenil before three months, which I used to have for the past 20 years for fatty tumors in my arm. Is there anything I can take to bring both the liver function and sugar down?",
        "output": "Hello. Is this the only liver function test you have? I wanted to trend it. Plaquenil (Hydroxychloroquine) and Protonix (Pantoprazole) both can cause elevated liver function test, but it is relatively rare with Protonix. I also want to make sure that you are not using Aspirin, Tylenol or cholesterol medications, since they can have direct effects on the liver. Another important point is that the slight elevation of lipase and blood sugar can happen in pancreatitis, which again could be a rare side effect of Protonix. But, this point goes against the fact that the elevation of blood sugar is out of the proportion to the lipase levels. A person, who has prediabetes, may develop full blown diabetes transiently under physiological stress. I was trying to understand if you had been tested for diabetes ever and if this blood sugar was obtained in fasting. For high blood sugars, I would suggest that you try to avoid high carbohydrate diet, soda, bakery products, white bread or pasta and juices. Hydrate yourself with plenty of water. Can you please share your symptoms and for how long did you have them? Please also share if you have been worked up for lupus or autoimmune hepatitis and your entire medication list if you can?

My medications were Olmezest 10 mg once daily in the morning and Prolomet XL 50 mg once daily in the evening. Now I am diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. My readings are FBS 141, PPBS 236 and BP 130/80. My physician has prescribed me Gemer 1 twice daily and Tazloc-H 40 mg once daily. I heard that Metformin ER has to be taken daily once but he asked me to take twice daily. I would like to know whether my medicines are fine or not. Do I need any more medicine? Also my heart rate was higher earlier but is under control with the use of Prolomet XL. Now the Prolomet is replaced by Tazloc-H 40 mg. Will it be a problem? Please help.",
        "output": "Hi. Previously, you were on tablet Olmezest (Olmesartan) and tablet Prolomet XL 50 (Metoprolol tartrate). Now you are on diabetic medication and tablet Tazloc-H 40 (Telmisartan). Tablet Olmezest and tablet Tazloc are similar kind of drugs. So, taking one drug is enough. I think you are taking tablet Tazloc-H alone now. It is a good tablet. It prevents heart problems, kidney failure and will make you to pass more urine. Take one tablet after breakfast regularly. You were taking tablet Prolomet XL. We usually prescribe this for severe hypertension or tachycardia (increased heart rate). Since you have both hypertension and diabetes, I request you to buy one blood pressure machine and glucometer. Please check your pulse rate four to five times a day and record. It can be done by using a BP machine or you can check yourself manually. Just put two fingers in left wrist, far left side. See the watch and count your pulse for one minute. It should be less than 90. If your pulse rate is more than 90 per minute regularly, then we can start back tablet Prolomet XL. Similarly, if tablet Tazloc-H is not enough to control BP, we can start tablet Prolomet XL. Your fasting blood sugar (FBS) and post prandial blood sugar (PPBS) are both high. As you have started the diabetes drugs recently, we can check FBS and PPBS after 15 days of drugs and can adjust medications. The maximum dose of the tablet Metformin ER (extended release) is about 2000 mg. So, we can safely prescribe two 1000 mg ER morning and night. True, tablet Metformin ER works for 24 hours. So, we can take up to 2000 mg ER once a day. But, if we take in two doses (500/850/1000 mg) there will be a constant presence of Metformin in blood. So, no need to worry. For urine infection, drink plenty of water. Take syrup Urikind (Potassium magnesium citrate) 10 ml mixed in one glass of water three times a day. Diabetes can cause urine infection and controlling blood sugar will reduce the frequency of getting urine infections.

Before I am able to help you in this regard, I would like to have the following additional information: What was the location of the original and recent bumps? Specifically, were they on the upper side of the toe near the hairy area or over the soles? What has been the duration of the first bump? Can you post a photograph of the same? In case the bumps are on the upper side of the toe, in particular, if they seem to be arising from or near the hair follicles, then they could indicate furuncles, which are deep-seated infections of the hair follicle and though they can arise in healthy individuals, they are a little more common in diabetics. They are painful, warm and become hard, but often show a visible yellowish pus point. In that case, we would have to suggest a short course of oral antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines and suggest an antibiotic cream. In case they are on the sole i.e. undersurface of the toes, then they could be corns. But corns typically are of long duration, appear over pressure prone areas of the toe and do not subside on their own. They also hurt on walking. They can be treated medically as well as surgically. Thus, to be able to guide you for the best treatment, I need to have your answers to my three questions raised above.",

Keep a check on your exercise minutes, you can easily do 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week which includes walking, bicycling, and other forms of moderate muscle strengthening exercises. Just keep in mind that your sugar level must not go down, do not reduce your insulin dosage. Also never skip a meal, if you skip a meal you will tend to indulge more calories in the next meal.

Now as per the investigation the disease has progressed to an advanced stage. Here is what we can do: Fluorescein angiography of the eye to identify all culprit areas. By a laser, we will have to burn those areas which are causing the problem. We have to inject some anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inside her eye so that swelling comes down. But if blood is too much we have to go for surgery. Consult the retina specialist in your town. For the time being start her on Timolol eye drop twice daily.

Peripheral neuropathy, probably due to diabetes or due to Sodium oxybate (Xyrem) or compression of nerves in the spinal column. The diagnosis can be fixed by clinical examination of motor, power and sensory system and reflexes followed by nerve conduction study. This will tell whether the problem is in the nerves of your legs and feet or whether the problem is in the spinal cord. You may also need to do a glucose tolerance test to rule out diabetes. Even though, Oxybate can cause peripheral neuropathy, diabetes is a more common cause. I would suggest that you at least evaluate your blood glucose levels, so that we can start treatment for the pain. 1.

        "input": "Hi doctor, I need some advice on behalf of my mother who is 67 years old. For the past 12 days my mother has been experiencing pain in the throat area, feels like something is stuck, vomiting mucous, weakness, body aches, white tongue, difficulty swallowing, and vomiting feeling while talking and eating. She vomits about twice a day. She consulted an ENT and internal medicine doctor. ENT dismissed her after nothing found in throat using a camera but the internal medicine doctor did some investigations. Results showed UTI (epithelial cells 20-25/HPF and pus cells 30-35) and TSH (13.5) raised as well as Candida Albicans growth from a throat swab. She has had this issue every few months and normally clears up on its own, but this time it is very severe and not going away. Current medication: Cefotil (Cefuroxime 500 mg and Clavulanic acid 125 mg), Gelora gel for oral thrush (Miconazole BP 2%), Motigut for vomiting 10mg), Thyroxine (50 mcg currently but internal medicine doctor asked to increase the dose to 1.5 tablets due to high TSH). Urine culture was done and it was normal. My query is, whether this is a bad infection, not bacterial but growth of esophageal candidiasis can be treated by antifungal therapy Fluconazole? No improvements are seen with many antibiotics. Oral thrush candida was found on initial appointments and also candida in throat swab. Is there any harm in trying a course of Fluconazole? She had a history of fungal infections in the throat which normally clear up on its own. This time it seems much more serious. If it is fine, what dosage would you recommend and for what period?",
        "output": "Hello. Yes, your mother is suffering from 1. Hypothyroidism. 2. Oral candidiasis. 3. UTI (urinary tract infection). 4. Dysphagia. Oral candidiasis or oral thrush if not improved within five days after starting local antifungals then you may start oral antifungal medication. You may use tablet AF (Fluconazole) 150 mg once a day for one week. But in case of old age, people may feel nausea or vomiting for this drug then you can give iv Fluconazole (Forcan 100 ml) once a day for five days. In old age, vitamin B12 deficiency is also common, so it may present like glossitis with pharyngitis. Take vitamin B12 injection weekly once. You can give Neurobion injection also. Use Candid B mouth paint for local application. Use tablet Levosulfuride 25 mg twice a day for nausea and vomiting. At the same time check for serum electrolytes levels which may be altered in old age lead to vomiting. You may give probiotics like capsule Gut ok or Sporulac sachets to increase the immunity levels and also prevent gut growth of fungus. Remaining medications you continue the same. Response to the treatment may take four to five days. Diabetic patients are more prone to oral candidiasis so check for blood sugar.",

So hormonal oral contraceptives should be started only after five days, to be assured that there is no reduced effect of combined oral contraceptives due to Ulipristal, which is a selective progesterone receptor modulator.

The doctor gave me some antibiotics and some pain killers and Vitamin B. The pain was almost gone but there was some numbness in the same leg and stayed for almost a month but what I noticed is that I kept feeling like some urine in dripping from me, some times I find nothing and sometimes I find something but I am not sure if it is urine or not. A month ago I got a urine tested and there was nothing but I still have this same feeling like urine is coming out of me. I used to not drink water, some days I only drink one or 2 cups and I fear public restrooms so I used to keep urine almost 12 hours, can that be the cause?",
        "output": "Hi. I read your question that one month ago you had left leg pain and you also have a recurrent urinary tract infection. You are a young woman, no diabetes because I saw your HbA1c report that is less than 6.5 which means you do not have any diabetes mellitus. Coming to your symptoms, left leg pain and dribbling of urine. I want you to get a basic blood test done which is complete blood count renal profile, liver function test, urine routine and also check your vitamin B12 and vitamin D as well. When there is a deficiency in B12, your nerves will lose its functioning normal level. Drink plenty of fluids and water because that will help one from getting too many episodes of urinary tract infections. Drink as much as you can but not more than six liters and eat healthily. Avoid deep fried items like chicken, burger, sauce, chicken fries. Drink tender coconut water, eating banana will also help you get rid of some muscle pain. In order to answer the question perfectly I need to get a basic blood investigation and in the meantime take a regular painkiller like Paracetamol or Acetaminophen 650 mg twice a day whenever needed and you please get back to me if you have your old blood reports, you can send it to me. I will just take a look.",

Flashes can signify many conditions affecting the inner layers of the eye starting with the vitreous (the gel structure pressing down the retina - in high myopes it is usually dissociated) where floaters are usually located. If you have high blood pressure or diabetes, elements of blood can form in that space and start floating (floaters). The way to detect if it is in the vitreous is to look sideways and if the floater follows the motion of the eye (slowly in the same direction) then it is in the vitreous and does not require quick intervention. If the distortion is in the same position in whatever direction you look then we are talking about the retina and retinal detachment which should be urgently excluded. If you are seeing a halo around the source of light then your eye pressure might be increased and requires urgent attention.",

If your RCA can still be opened by angioplasty is the issue to be decided by interventional cardiologist. In view of recent STEMI and EF of 35 %, you should not ride a bicycle or do strenuous exercise. Pulmonary edema, recurrent angina and heart attack are all possibilities for which you are being treated. Do not worry much. Keep yourself relaxed.

He is having an erection but is unable to sustain it during the intercourse. Firstly, he is not sure if he is suffering from ED or is it just anxiety. Are there any tests to be sure of ED? Secondly, if it is diagnosed to be ED (which most probably can be), can this be cured? How will his sexual life be? If it is curable, can it be cured with natural methods or medicine or surgery? If it cannot be cured, is there an alternative for him to have a happy sexual life?",

Is he able to achieve an erection sufficient for vaginal penetration during intercourse? Is the loss of erection due to early ejaculation or happens without ejaculation?  The mechanism of erection can be tested by a penile doppler study during which the response to medication can also be tested. If he is able to achieve an erection sufficient for vaginal penetration, then the cause is more likely to be either psychological or just early ejaculation. A detailed clinical examination is also required to make sure that there are no other abnormalities that can affect full erection. At this age, the cause is most likely anxiety, but given his history of diabetes, a full evaluation is necessary to rule or other causes. The treatment is based on his most predominant concerns, though it cannot be completely cured, it can definitely be managed to get a normal sexual life.",

This clinical presentation of an anti-OJ antibody-positive ASS has not been reported before. A 75-year-old male, was admitted to our hospital complaining of recurrent joint pain for more than 1 year, recurrent fever for 6 months, and recurrence of joint pain and fever for 1 week. The patient had a history of chronic viral hepatitis B, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surgery 11 years ago, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. In the past year, the patient visited Departments of orthopedics, Infectious Medicine and rheumatology for many times, and has undergone positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), bone marrow puncture and other examinations, but the cause was still unknown. On admission, physical examination showed that the temperature was 39.6 â, and there was tenderness in multiple joints and muscles, such as the left ankle, the right shoulder, the left wrist, biceps brachii and quadriceps femoris, and so on. The laboratory results showed white blood cell (WBC) count of 30,500ÂµL (neutrophils 90.1%), C-reactive protein (CRP) 140.79 mgdL, Creatine Kinase and creatine kinase-MB were normal. Because of the muscle tenderness, myositis antibody tests were performed and the anti-OJ autoantibody was positive. Asking the medical history in detail, the patient had myasthenia, which was covered up due to prominent joint pain and fever. The patient had no interstitial pneumonia and mechanics hand. Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma was confirmed 1 year after the diagnosis of ASS, and the clinical symptoms were relieved after surgical resection. We report this rare case of anti-OJ antibody-positive ASS with atypical manifestations to raise awareness of the disease for clinicians. For patients with recurrent unexplained arthritis with fever, we should consider ASS, and myositis antibody tests should be performed if necessary.

These include traits like reduced deformability, increased membrane viscosity, and change in cell shape, causing substantial changes in the overall hemodynamics. RBCs, by virtue of their highly elastic membrane and low bending rigidity, exhibit complex dynamics when exposed to cyclic, transient forces in the microcirculation. Here, we employ mesoscopic numerical simulations based on the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) framework to explore the dynamics of healthy, schizont stage malaria-infected and type 2 diabetes mellitus affected RBCs subjected to external time-dependent loads. The paper focuses on the imposition and cessation of external forcing on the cells of two different typologies, saw-tooth cyclic wave loading and sudden loads in the form of creep and relaxation phenomena. The effects of varying the rate of stress and the applied stress magnitude were investigated. Our simulations disclosed unique shape transitions of the hysteresis curves at varied loading rates. A careful analysis reveals a critical threshold of half cycle time of the from wherein the deformation of all cells observed, healthy or otherwise, falls under the nearly reversible deformation regime displaying minimal energy dissipation. Finally, we also examined the individual effects of the different constitutive and geometric characteristics attributed to the pathological cells and observed interesting recovery dynamics of spherocytes and cells having high shear moduli. The distinguished deformation behaviour of healthy and diseased cells could establish external force as a valuable initial biomarker.",

In this study, we tested the effectivity of the P450 inhibition assay in a DILI mouse model treated with acetaminophen (APAP). We found that TNF-Î± expression was upregulated in the APAP-treated group, and CYP2E1 gene expression was significantly decreased at 8 h after treatment. In the P450 inhibition assay, in which sera were used, significant changes in CYP2E1 and CYP3A5 levels were observed 8 and 24 h after APAP administration, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed significant inhibition rate changes the area under the curve values of CYP2E1 and CYP3A5 were above 0.8, at 0.832 and 0.849, respectively. In conclusion, we suggest that P450 inhibition assay could be used for the diagnosis of liver diseases, such as acute DILI.",

However, multiparous women are known to have a lower risk of developing either ovarian or endometrial cancer than nonparous women. The lack of ovulation and shifting of sex hormonal balance, with decreased estrogen levels and increased progesterone levels during pregnancy, has traditionally been thought to be the major contributor to this decreased risk. However, in reality, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are relatively unknown. Increasing evidence suggests that endocrine factors are unlikely to completely explain the protective effect of pregnancies, and that multiple other nonendocrine mechanisms including fetal antigens and the newly proposed dormant cells hypothesis may also be involved.

The results were reconstructed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). WM microstructural abnormalities were identified using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Pointwise WM tract differences were detected through automatic fiber quantification (AFQ). The relationships between WM tract abnormalities and clinical characteristics were explored with partial correlation analysis. TBSS revealed widespread WM lesions in T2DM patients with decreased fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity and an increased orientation dispersion index (ODI). The AFQ results showed microstructural abnormalities in T2DM patients in specific portions of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), right arcuate fasciculus (ARC), left anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), and forceps major (FMA). In the right ARC of T2DM patients, an aberrant ODI was positively correlated with fasting insulin and insulin resistance, and an abnormal intracellular volume fraction was negatively correlated with fasting blood glucose. Additionally, negative associations were found between blood pressure and microstructural abnormalities in the right ARC, left ATR, and FMA in T2DM patients. Using AFQ, together with DTI and NODDI, various kinds of microstructural alterations in the right SLF, right ARC, left ATR, and FMA can be accurately identified and may be associated with insulin and glucose status and blood pressure in T2DM patients.",

Evidence has linked the DM-related dysbiosis of gut microbiota to modifiable host immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, the crosslinks between gut microbiota composition and immunological effects on the development of latent TB infection (LTBI) in DM patients remain uncertain. We prospectively obtained stool, blood samples, and medical records from 130 patients with poorly-controlled DM (pDM), defined as ever having an HbA1c > 9.0% within previous 1 year. Among them, 43 had LTBI, as determined by QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-Tube assay. The differences in the taxonomic diversity of gut microbiota between LTBI and non-LTBI groups were investigated using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, and a predictive algorithm was established using a random forest model. Serum cytokine levels were measured to determine their correlations with gut microbiota. Compared with non-LTBI group, the microbiota in LTBI group displayed a similar alpha-diversity but different beta-diversity, featuring decrease of Prevotella9, Streptococcus, and Actinomyces and increase of Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Blautia at the genus level. The accuracy was 0.872 for the LTBI prediction model using the aforementioned 6 microbiome-based biomarkers. Compared with the non-LTBI group, the LTBI group had a significantly lower serum levels of IL-17F (p 0.025) and TNF-Î± (p 0.038), which were correlated with the abundance of the aforementioned 6 taxa.

Glaucoma suspects underwent fundus photography, Goldmann applanation tonometry, visual field testing and gonioscopy. Glaucoma was determined according to the International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology classification scheme. Associations of demographics and medical factors with glaucoma were assessed using multiple logistic regression models. From June 2017 to October 2018, 48 398 of 52 041 participants were included in the final analyses.

        "input": "Bone tissue engineering is a promising approach that uses seed-cell-scaffold drug delivery systems to reconstruct bone defects caused by trauma, tumors, or other diseases (e.g., periodontitis). Metformin, a widely used medication for type II diabetes, has the ability to enhance osteogenesis and angiogenesis by promoting cell migration and differentiation. Metformin promotes osteogenic differentiation, mineralization, and bone defect regeneration via activation of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. Bone tissue engineering depends highly on vascular networks for adequate oxygen and nutrition supply. Metformin also enhances vascular differentiation via the AMPKmechanistic target of the rapamycin kinase (mTOR)NLR family pyrin domain containing the 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling axis. This is the first review article on the effects of metformin on stem cells and bone tissue engineering. In this paper, we review the cutting-edge research on the effects of metformin on bone tissue engineering. This includes metformin delivery via tissue engineering scaffolds, metformin-induced enhancement of various types of stem cells, and metformin-induced promotion of osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and its regulatory pathways.

To understand the molecular basis of PTAs, we have investigated the genetic association amongst PTAs, CVD and T2D through an integrative network-based approach and observed a remarkable resemblance. The current study proposed to compare the PTAs-associated proteins with the overlapping proteins of CVD and T2D to determine the disease relationship. We constructed the protein-protein interaction network by integrating curated and experimentally validated interactions in humans. We found the $11$ highly clustered modules in the network, which contain a total of $13$ hub proteins (TP53, ESR1, EGFR, POTEF, MEN1, FLNA, CDKN2B, ACTB, CTNNB1, CAV1, MAPK1, G6PD and CCND1) that commonly co-exist in PTAs, CDV and T2D and reached to networks hierarchically modular organization. Additionally, we implemented a gene-set over-representation analysis over biological processes and pathways that helped to identify disease-associated pathways and prioritize target disease proteins. Moreover, we identified the respective drugs of these hub proteins. We built a bipartite network that helps decipher the drug-target interaction, highlighting the influential roles of these drugs on apparently unrelated targets and pathways. Targeting these hub proteins by using drug combinations or drug-repurposing approaches will improve the clinical conditions in comorbidity, enhance the potency of a few drugs and give a synergistic effect with better outcomes. This network-based analysis opens a new horizon for more personalized treatment and drug-repurposing opportunities to investigate new targets and multi-drug treatment and may be helpful in further analysis of the mechanisms underlying PTA and associated diseases.",

        "input": "Extrusion is a thermomechanical technology that has been widely used in the production of various starch-based foods and can transform raw materials into edible products with unique nutritional characteristics. Starch digestibility is a crucial nutritional factor that can largely determine the human postprandial glycemic response, and frequent consumption of foods with rapid starch digestibility is related to the occurrence of type 2 diabetes. The extrusion process involves starch degradation and order-disorder structural transition, which could result in large variance in starch digestibility in these foods depending on the raw material properties and processing conditions. It provides opportunities to modify starch digestibility by selecting a desirable combination of raw food materials and extrusion settings. This review firstly introduces the application of extrusion techniques in starch-based food production, while, more importantly, it discusses the effects of extrusion on the alteration of starch structures and consequentially starch digestibility in various foods. This review contains important information to generate a new generation of foods with slow starch digestibility by the extrusion technique.",

        "input": "Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Dietary intake of polyphenols may protect against the development of NCDs. Coffee is a rich source of phenolic acids in the Western diet that may prevent or treat hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, chronic liver diseases, and obesity. These health effects are attributed, at least partially, to the antioxidant properties and inhibitory activity of phenolic acids on lipases. However, the effect of milk on these properties is not clear. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the antiradical properties and inhibitory activity on pancreatic lipase in vitro of phenolic acids from coffee. We obtained commercial traditional and decaffeinated espresso coffee capsules and prepared the beverages according to the manufacturers instructions using a domestic coffee maker. Espresso prepared with traditional and decaffeinated coffee capsules were evaluated with and without the addition of milk following in vitro digestion.The total phenolic content ranged from 168.21 to 397.38 mg equivalent to chlorogenic acidmL. All coffee-based beverages showed antioxidant activity, with emphasis on decaffeinated and milk-added beverages, respectively. Caffeic acid was the most abundant phenolic compound followed by 5-caffeoylquinic acid before digestion. In contrast after in vitro digestion, only caffeic acid was bioaccessible. The addition of milk improved the bioaccessibility of caffeic acid and caffeine. Overall, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of the samples for pancreatic lipase varied between 222 and 3035.8 ÂµgmL. Decaffeinated coffee had a greater inhibitory effect than regular coffee regardless of milk addition. In conclusion, decaffeinated and milk-added coffee beverages have a greater effect on lipase inhibition. This may be related to the greater bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds in these samples. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of enzymatic inhibition by phenolic acids.",

Materials and methods The cross-sectional study consecutively enrolled 115 persistent AF patients with the duration of its episode â¥90 days (82 (71,3 %) males mean age 59 Â± 11 years). Transthoracic (TEE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) were performed. LASEC (by TEE) was observed in 79 (68,7 %) patients. The dense (moderÂ¬ate-to-severe) LASEC was detected in 23 (20,0 %) cases. Results Heart failure (HF) stage C (OR 2,09 (95 % CI 1,24-3,53) p0,006), lower TEE-derived left atrial appendage (LAA) flow velocity (FV) (OR 0,94 (95 % CI 0,91-0,98) p0,003), and the presence of TTE-derived pulmonary hypertension (PH), appeared to be strongly associated with LASEC (AUC for logistic regression model 0,83 95 % Ð¡I 0,75- 0,89).

The study included 44 T2DM with HT, 94 T2DM, and 112 healthy subjects. We investigated some laboratory factors like thyroid hormone and compared the levels. Independent predictors determination by logistic univariate regression analysis were analyzed. The diagnostic value of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and threshold concentration were determined by ROC curve. In T2DM with HT group, levels of PTH, HbA1c were lower and levels of TSH were significantly higher, when compared with T2DM group. But there was no significant difference in vitamin D between these two groups. In both logistic univariate regression analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis, TSH, HbA1c were independent predictors for T2DM with HT. Based on the ROC curve, the best cut-off value of the TSH was 4 mIUL (sensitivity 72.7%, specificity 94.6%, AUC 0.832) for predicting T2DM with HT in T2DM patients. TSH has increased risk for T2DM evolving into T2DM complicated with HT, so it is important to monitor the concentrations of TSH in patients with T2DM. Although vitamin D was not the independent predictor in T2DM with HT development, effect of vitamin D deficiency on the progress of diabetes and its complications should be taken into consideration.",

Impaired fasting glucose is a marker of heightened risk for developing type 2 diabetes among perinatally HIV-infected individuals. Therefore, identifying individuals at this stage is crucial to enable early intervention. Therefore, we assessed impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and associated factors among perinatally HIV-infected population in Dar es salaam Tanzania. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 152 adolescents and youth attending HIV clinic at Muhimbili National Hospital and Infectious Disease Centre from July to August 2020. Fasting blood glucose (>8 hours) was measured using Of the 152 participants, the majority were male (n8354.6%), and the median age was 15(14-18) years. Overweight or obesity was prevalent in 16.4%, while more than one in ten (13.2%) had high blood pressure (â¥14990mmHg). All participants were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) 46% had used medication for over ten years, and about one in three had poor medication adherence. Among the recruited participants, 29% had impaired fasting glucose. The odds of IFG were two times higher in males compared to females (PR, 2.07, 95% CI 1.19 -3.59 p0.001). Moreover, we found with every increase of Interleukin 6 biomarker there was a 1.01 probability increase of impaired fasting glucose (PR, 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 - 1.02 p0.003). About one in three perinatally HIV-infected youths had impaired fasting glucose in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, with males bearing the biggest brunt.

Despite decades of research, the effect of methylglyoxal on the structure and function of insulin is still unknown. Through a shift in conformation at the B-chain C-terminal (BT-CT) hinge from an open to a wide-open conformation, insulin binds to the receptor and activates the signal cascade. Insulin resistance, which is the main sign of Type 2 Diabetes, can be caused by a lack of insulin signaling. Methylglyoxal site-specific glycation in residue R22 at B chain forms AGE product Methylglyoxal-hydroimidazolone (MGH1) in insulin. In this work, we present molecular dynamics study of this glycated insulin R22MGH1, which revealed new insights into the conformational and structural changes. We find the following key results 1) B-chain in insulin undergoes a closed conformational change upon glycation. 2) Glycated insulin shows secondary structure alteration. 3) Glycated insulin retains its closed shape due to an unusually strong hydrophobic contact between B-chain residues. 4) Wide open native conformation of insulin allows the B chain helix to be surrounded by more water molecules compared to the closed conformation of glycated insulin. The closed conformation of glycated insulin impairs its binding to insulin receptor (IR).",

        "input": "Legumes, including lentil, are a valuable source of carbohydrates, fiber, protein and vitamins and minerals. Their nutritional characteristics have been associated with a reduction in the incidence of various cancers, HDL cholesterol, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Among these quality parameters, lectins have been associated with reducing certain forms of cancer, activating innate defense mechanisms and managing obesity. Protease inhibitors such as trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of certain cancers and demonstrate potent anti-inflammatory properties. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has been associated with a reduction in hypertension. Therefore, legumes, including lentils, should be part of our daily food intake. However, high temperatures at the terminal stage is a major abiotic constraint leading to a reduction in lentil yield and seed quality. Thus, the selection of heat-tolerant genotypes is essential to identifying the potential for high yields with stable performance. To select lentil genotypes, an experiment was conducted with 60 genotypes including local landraces, advanced breeding lines, commercial varieties and exotic germplasm under stress and non-stress conditions from 2019 to 2020. This study was followed by a subset study involving screening based on a few physicochemical parameters and reproductive traits along with field performances. Different tolerance indices (i.e., stress susceptible index (SSI), relative heat index (RHI), tolerance (TOL), mean productivity (MP), stress tolerance index (STI), geometric mean productivity (GMP), yield index (YI), yield stability index (YSI), heat-resistance index (HRI), modified stress-tolerance index (MSTI), abiotic tolerance index (ATI) and stress susceptibility percentage (SSPI)) were used for the selection of the genotypes along with field performance. Biplot analysis was further performed for choosing the most suitable indices. Based on principal components analysis, the GMP, MP, RRI, STI, YI, YSI, ATI and MSTI indices were identified as the most reliable stress indicators, and these indicators might be used for distinguishing heat-tolerant genotypes. Based on the stress indices, the genotypes BLX 05002-3, BLX 10002-20, LRIL-21-1-1-1-1, LRIL-21-1-1-1-1-6 and BLX 09015 were selected as the most stable and heat-tolerant genotypes. In contrast, the genotypes LG 198, Bagura Local, BLX 0200-08-4, RL-12-178, Maitree, 91517 and BLX 11014-8 were selected as the most heat sensitive. Data also exhibited an average yield reduction of 59% due to heat stress on the lentils.

Comparative studies on reproductive function and physiochemical traits revealed significantly higher pollen viability, proline accumulation, relative water content, chlorophyll concentration and a lower membrane stability index in HT genotypes under heat stress.

In the test and control group, patients were advised to rinse with an S persica-based mouthwash and a non-alcoholic 0.12% CHX after NSPT twice daily for 2 weeks, respectively. Demographic data were collected. Full-mouth plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment loss (AL) were measured, and whole salivary TNF-Î± levels were gauged at baseline and at 3-month follow-up. Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were measured in all patients at baseline and at 3-month follow-up. Sample size estimation was done, and group comparison was performed. Level of significance was set at P < .01. Twenty-one nondiabetic individuals and 21 patients with T2DM were included. At baseline, there was no significant difference in clinical and radiographic periodontal parameters amongst in patients with and without T2DM. At 3-month follow-up, HbA1c, TNF-Î±, PI, PD, and clinical AL were comparable with their respective baseline values in the test and control groups amongst patients with T2DM. In nondiabetic individuals, there was a significant reduction in PI (P < .01), GI (P < .01), and PD (P < .01), and TNF-Î± (P < .01) at 3-month follow-up in the test and control groups compared with their respective baseline scores. In the short term, NSPT with 0.12% CHX or S persica-based mouthwashes is more effective in reducing periodontal inflammation and whole salivary TNF-Î± levels in nondiabetic individuals than in patients with T2DM with periodontal inflammation.",

        "input": "To determine whether nailfold capillary images, acquired using video capillaroscopy, can provide diagnostic information about diabetes and its complications. Nailfold video capillaroscopy was performed in 120 adult patients with and without type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and with and without cardiovascular disease. Nailfold images were analyzed using convolutional neural networks, a deep learning technique. Cross-validation was used to develop and test the ability of models to predict five5 prespecified states (diabetes, high glycosylated hemoglobin, cardiovascular event, retinopathy, albuminuria, and hypertension). The performance of each model for a particular state was assessed by estimating areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROC) and precision recall curves (AUPR). A total of 5236 nailfold images were acquired from 120 participants (mean 44 images per participant) and were all available for analysis. Models were able to accurately identify the presence of diabetes, with AUROC 0.84 (95% confidence interval CI 0.76, 0.91) and AUPR 0.84 (95% CI 0.78, 0.93), respectively. Models were also able to predict a history of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes, with AUROC 0.65 (95% CI 0.51, 0.78) and AUPR 0.72 (95% CI 0.62, 0.88) respectively. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of machine learning for identifying people with microvascular capillary changes from diabetes based on nailfold images, and for possibly identifying those most likely to have diabetes-related complications. ç®çæ¢è®¨è§é¢æ¯ç»è¡ç®¡éè·åçç²è¥æ¯ç»è¡ç®¡å¾åè½å¦æä¾ç³å°¿çåå¶å¹¶åççè¯æ­ä¿¡æ¯ã æ¹æ³å¯¹120ä¾æäººæ£èè¿è¡è§é¢ç²è¥æ¯ç»è¡ç®¡éæ£æ¥, æ£èæææ 1åæ2åç³å°¿ç, æææ å¿è¡ç®¡ç¾çãä½¿ç¨å·ç§¯ç¥ç»ç½ç»(CNNs), ä¸ç§æ·±åº¦å­¦ä¹ ææ¯å¯¹ç²è¥å¾åè¿è¡åæãäº¤åéªè¯ç¨äºå¼ååæ£éªæ¨¡åé¢æµ5ç§é¢è®¾ç¶æ(ç³å°¿çãé«HbA",

Numerous studies have generated gene expression profiles in individual islet cell types using single cell assays. However, there is no canonical reference of gene expression in islet cell types in both health and disease that is also easily accessible for researchers to access, query, and use in bioinformatics pipelines. Here we present an integrated reference map of islet cell type-specific gene expression from 192,203 cells derived from single cell RNA-seq assays of 65 non-diabetic, T1D autoantibody positive (Aab), T1D, and T2D donors from the Human Pancreas Analysis Program. We identified 10 endocrine and non-endocrine cell types as well as sub-populations of several cell types, and defined sets of marker genes for each cell type and sub-population. We tested for differential expression within each cell type in T1D Aab, T1D, and T2D states, and identified 1,701 genes with significant changes in expression in any cell type. Most changes were observed in beta cells in T1D, and, by comparison, there were almost no genes with changes in T1D Aab. To facilitate user interaction with this reference, we provide the data using several single cell visualization and reference mapping tools as well as open-access analytical pipelines used to create this reference. The results will serve as a valuable resource to investigators studying islet biology and diabetes.",

        "input": "While aging is the main risk factor for AlzheimerÂ´s disease (AD), emerging evidence suggests that metabolic alterations such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) are also major contributors. Indeed, several studies have described a close relationship between AD and T2D with clinical evidence showing that both diseases coexist. A hallmark pathological event in AD is amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) deposition in the brain as either amyloid plaques or around leptomeningeal and cortical arterioles, thus constituting cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is observed in 85-95% of autopsy cases with AD and it contributes to AD pathology by limiting perivascular drainage of AÎ². To further explore these alterations when AD and T2D coexist, we have used in vivo multiphoton microscopy to analyze over time the AÎ² deposition in the form of plaques and CAA in a relevant model of AD (APPswePS1dE9) combined with T2D (dbdb). We have simultaneously assessed the effects of high-fat diet-induced prediabetes in AD mice. Since both plaques and CAA are implicated in oxidative-stress mediated vascular damage in the brain, as well as in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), we have also analyzed oxidative stress by Amplex Red oxidation, MMP activity by DQ We found that prediabetes accelerates amyloid plaque and CAA deposition, suggesting that initial metabolic alterations may directly affect AD pathology. T2D significantly affects vascular pathology and CAA deposition, which is increased in AD-T2D mice, suggesting that T2D favors vascular accumulation of AÎ². Moreover, T2D synergistically contributes to increase CAA mediated oxidative stress and MMP activation, affecting red blood cell velocity. Our data support the cross-talk between metabolic disease and AÎ² deposition that affects vascular integrity, ultimately contributing to AD pathology and related functional changes in the brain microvasculature.",

In this study individual anxiety disorders and clinically relevant generalized anxiety symptoms are studied in relation to multiple cognitive domains. This cross-sectional study includes 7344 community-dwelling participants of The Maastricht Study aged 40-75 years and oversampling of type 2 diabetes. Panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, agoraphobia and lifetime panic disorder were measured with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Generalized anxiety symptoms were measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7). Multiple cognitive domains (executive functioning, memory and processing speed) and cognitive impairment were assessed. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were used with adjustment for potential confounders. Interaction analyses were performed to test the moderation of age, sex and type 2 diabetes (due to oversampling). Agoraphobia was associated with worse scores on all cognitive domains (range B -0.12 to -0.10 range 95%CI -0.20 to -0.04) and with higher odds of cognitive impairment (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.18-1.93).

It is necessary to elucidate the potential compounds and targets of SJHK for T2DM treatment by conducting network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses. Information about the chemical constituents of SJHK were collected, and druggable compounds were screened based on oral bioavailability and drug-likeness. Putative target genes of druggable compounds and T2DM-related genes were retrieved from public databases. A compound-target network was constructed to visualize the relationship between the druggable compounds in SJHK and common targets related to T2DM. The constructed network was further investigated through Protein-Protein Interaction, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses, and molecular docking. Compound-target network analysis demonstrated that kaempferol, salicylic acid, estrone, and Î²-sitosterol were key compounds of SJHK with PTGS2, ESR1, PRKAA2, PRKAB1, and CYP19A1 being its key targets. Estrogen signaling, AGE-RAGE signaling, insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and TNF signaling pathway were potential pathways involved in the effect of SJHK on T2DM. Molecular docking simulations revealed that estrone and Î²-sitosterol had the strong binding energies for all the key target proteins. This study demonstrates that network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses help to better understand the potential key compounds and targets of SJHK for treating T2DM as a complementary medicine. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disorder caused by genetic andor environmental factors. There has been a growing attention to new therapeutic approaches to treat T2DM using traditional medicine as a complementary treatment which is expected to have synergistic effects with few side effects.

        "input": "Low intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with an increased risk of various non-communicable diseases, including major causes of death and disability such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and cancers. Diets low in fruit and vegetables are prevalent in the South African (SA) population, and average intake is well below the internationally recommended threshold. To estimate the burden of disease attributable to a diet low in fruit and vegetables by sex and age group in SA for the years 2000, 2006 and 2012. We followed World Health Organization and Global Burden of Disease Study comparative risk assessment methodology. Population attributable fractions - calculated from fruit and vegetable intake estimated from national and local surveys and relative risks for health outcomes based on the current literature - were applied to the burden estimates from the second South African National Burden of Disease Study (SANBD2). Outcome measures included deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost from ischaemic heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and five categories of cancers. Between 2000 and 2012, the average intake of fruit of the SA adult population (â¥25 years) declined by 7%, from 48.5 gd (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 46.6 - 50.5) to 45.2 gd (95% UI 42.7 - 47.6). Vegetable intake declined by 25%, from 146.9 gd (95% UI 142.3 - 151.8) to 110.5 gd (95% UI 105.9 - 115.0). In 2012, these consumption patterns are estimated to have caused 26 423 deaths (95% UI 24 368 - 28 006), amounting to 5.0% (95% UI 4.6 - 5.3%) of all deaths in SA, and the loss of 514 823 (95% UI 473 508 - 544 803) healthy life years or 2.5% (95% UI 2.3 - 2.6%) of all DALYs. Cardiovascular disease comprised the largest proportion of the attributable burden, with 83% of deaths and 84% of DALYs. Age-standardised death rates were higher for males (145.1 deaths per 100 000 95% UI 127.9 - 156.2) than for females (108.0 deaths per 100 000 95% UI 96.2 - 118.1) in both sexes, rates were lower than those observed in 2000 (-9% and -12%, respectively). Despite the overall reduction in standardised death rates observed since 2000, the absolute burden of disease attributable to inadequate intake of fruit and vegetables in SA remains of significant concern. Effective interventions supported by legislation and policy are needed to reverse the declining trends in consumption observed in most age categories and to curb the associated burden.",

Chronic social stress is created frequently due to deviations in civilisation, education and tolerance. 4 The freeze response (or freezing behaviour) plays a subordinate role in the animal world it lasts mainly for a maximum of minutes, while in humans, it dominates and can continue for decades. 5 The decisive step of freeze is apnea, hypopnea, which occurs due to aversive psychological eff ects. After a more extended existence, mild chronic respiratory acidosis develops and most often appears in the clinical form of obstructive sleep apnea. 6 Chronic hypercapnia can shape the metabolism into metabolic syndrome. 7 After that, various cardiovascular and metabolic complications (hypertension, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, depression) may develop - partly due to genetic and lifestyle reasons.

Cadmium enters the human body through occupational exposure, diet, drinking water, breathing, and smoking. Cadmium accumulation in the human body is associated with increased risk of developing obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Cadmium uptake is enhanced during pregnancy and can cross the placenta affecting placental development and function. Subsequently, cadmium can pass to fetus, gathering in multiple organs such as the liver and pancreas. Early-life cadmium exposure can induce hepatic oxidative stress and pancreatic Î²-cell dysfunction, resulting in insulin resistance and glucose metabolic dyshomeostasis in the offspring.

This work was aimed at identifying contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) perfusion parameters, a microcirculatory biomarker indicative of early DKD progression. CEUS kidney flash-replenishment data were acquired in control, insulin resistant and diabetic vervet monkeys (N 16). By use of a mono-exponential model, time-intensity curve parameters related to blood volume (A), velocity (Î²) and flow rate (perfusion index PI) were extracted from 10 concentric kidney layers to study spatial perfusion patterns that could serve as strong indicators of disease. Mean squared error (MSE) was used to assess model performance. Features calculated from the perfusion parameters were inputs for the linear regression models to determine which features could distinguish between cohorts. The mono-exponential model performed well, with average MSEs (Â±standard deviation) of 0.0254 (Â±0.0210), 0.0321 (Â±0.0242) and 0.0287 (Â±0.0130) for the control, insulin resistant and diabetic cohorts, respectively. Perfusion index features, with blood pressure, were the best classifiers between cohorts (p < 0.05).

        "input": "In obstructing left-sided colonic or rectal cancer, endoscopic stent placement with the purpose of decompression and bridge to elective colon resection has been widely utilized and accepted. However, in malignant right-sided colonic obstruction, stent placement prior to colectomy is still highly controversial, due to lower clinical success and high anastomotic leak. We report a case of malignant right-sided colonic obstruction based on the radiological findings of irregular thickening of ascending colon wall and dilation of proximal large bowel on enhanced computed tomography scan. The 72-year-old woman presented with obvious abdominal distension. Due to concerning cardiovascular complications as intermittent chest pain and a long history of type 2 diabetes, a three-step therapeutic plan was instigated. Initially, a self-expandable metallic stent was placed palliatively to relieve the bowel obstruction. Consecutively, coronary angiography was performed, and two coronary stents were implanted to alleviate more than 80% stenosis of two main coronary arteries. One month later, laparoscopic radical resection of right colon and lymphadenectomy were successfully performed, with a blood loss less than 50 millimeters and a harvest of 29 lymph nodes, 1 being positive. The patient was discharged one week postoperatively with no complications, and received adjuvant chemotherapy one month later. During a follow-up of more than one year, the patient was in complete remission with no recurrence and cardiovascular events. In patients presenting with malignant right-sided colonic obstruction and peril of high cardiovascular risks, we propose colonic and coronary stent-first strategy to emergency surgery as a potential approach so as to ensure sufficient cardiovascular preparation improving perioperative safety. Moreover, the anatomical location of the tumor would be significantly achievable thus granting high-quality radical colon resection and lymphadenectomy.",

Even less is known about the treatment of AC in the Medicare population. We aimed to fully characterize initial treatment for AC in terms of initial treatment utilization, timing of initial treatments and treatment combinations. Using United States Medicare claims from 2010-2012, we explored treatment utilization and patient characteristics associated with initial treatment for primary AC among 7,181 Medicare beneficiaries. Patients with primary AC were identified as patients seeking care for a new shoulder complaint in 2011, with the first visit related to shoulder referred to as the index date, an x-ray or MRI of the shoulder region, and two separate diagnoses of AC (ICD-9-CM codes 726.00). The treatment period was defined as the 90 days immediately following the index shoulder visit. A multivariable logistic model was used to assess baseline patient factors associated with receiving surgery within the treatment period. Ninety percent of beneficiaries with primary AC received treatment within 90 days of their index shoulder visit. Physical therapy (PT) alone (41%) and injection combined with PT (34%) were the most common treatment approaches. Similar patient profiles emerged across treatment groups, with higher proportions of racial minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged and more frail patients favoring injections or watchful waiting. Black beneficiaries (OR 0.37, 0.16, 0.86) and those residing in the northeast (OR 0.36, 0.18, 0.69) had significantly lower odds of receiving surgery in the treatment period. Conversely, younger beneficiaries aged 66-69 years (OR 6.75, 2.12, 21.52) and 70-75 years (OR 5.37, 1.67, 17.17) and beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes had significantly higher odds of receiving surgery (OR 1.41, 1.03, 1.92).

        "input": "Epilepsy is a prevalent and frequently devastating neurological disorder defined by recurring spontaneous seizures caused by aberrant electrical activity in the brain. Over ten million people worldwide suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy. This severe condition requires novel treatment approaches. Both oxidative and nitrosative stress are thought to have a role in the etiology of epilepsy. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that is used to treat type-2 diabetes mellitus. According to recent studies, Liraglutide also shows neuroprotective properties, improving memory retention and total hippocampus pyramidal neuronal population in mice. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the anti-seizure and anti-oxidative effects of liraglutide in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced rat model of epilepsy. 48 rats were randomly assigned to two groups those who had electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and those who underwent behavioral assessment. Rats received either intraperitoneal (IP) liraglutide at two different dosages (3-6 mgkg) or a placebo, followed by pentylenetetrazole (IP). To determine if liraglutide has anti-seizure characteristics, we examined seizure activity in rats using EEG, the Racine convulsion scale (RCS), the time of first myoclonic jerk (FMJ), and MDA, SOD, TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² and GAD-67 levels. The mean EEG spike wave percentage score was reduced from 75.8% (placebo) to 59.4% (lower-dose) and 41.5% (higher-dose). FMJ had increased from a mean of 70.6 s (placebo) to 181.2 s (lower-dose) and 205.2 s (higher-dose). RCS was reduced from a mean of 5.5 (placebo) to 2.7 (lower-dose) and 2.4 (higher-dose). Liraglutide (3 and 6 mgkg i.p.) successfully decreased the spike percentages and RCS associated with PTZ induced epilepsy, as well as considerably decreased MDA, TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² and elevated SOD, GAD-67 levels in rat brain. Liraglutide significantly decreased seizure activity at both dosages when compared to control, most likely due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The potential clinical role of liraglutide as an anti-seizure medication should be further explored.",

Serum samples from patients with T2DM, AMI, and healthy subjects were analyzed using a new LC-MSMS method to evaluate TMAO and PAGln levels. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate TMAO and PAGln distributions among different groups. Retention and separation of the two metabolites were achieved within 5 min. For both analytes, the assay was linear in a 0.02-10 ÂµgmL range, with >0.99 average linear correlation coefficients, and quantification limit values of approximately 0.010 ÂµgmL. The average recoveries of TMAO and PAGln were 96.3 % and 96.4 %, respectively. The intra-run and total coefficient variations were 3.5-4.8 % and 3.9-5.7 % respectively for TMAO and 4.0-5.1 % and 4.6-6.3 % respectively for PAGln. TMAO and PAGln showed a moderate correlation (P < 0.001) and their levels in patients with T2DM were significantly higher than those in healthy individuals (P < 0.001). TMAO levels were higher in patients with T2DM than in patients with AMI (P < 0.01). Patients with AMI had higher PAGln levels than healthy individuals (P < 0.05). After adjusting for sex and age, the top tertile of PAGln was positively correlated with T2DM and AMI while that of TMAO was positively correlated with T2DM.

There are two main types of this disease type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Insulin therapy is pivotal to the management of diabetes. Over the last two decades, many routes of administration, including nasal, pulmonary, rectal, transdermal, buccal, and ocular, have been investigated. Nevertheless, subcutaneous parenteral administration is still the most common route for insulin therapy. To overcome poor bioavailability and the barriers to oral insulin absorption, novel approaches in the field of oral drug delivery and administration have been brought about by the coalescence of different branches of nanoscience and nanotechnology, such as nanomedicine, nano-biochemistry, and nano-pharmacy. Novel drug delivery systems, including nanoparticles, nano-platforms, and nanocarriers, have been suggested. The objective of this review is to provide an update on the various promising approaches that have been explored and evaluated for the safe and efficient oral and buccal administration of insulin.",

Computer simulation can save time and costs, alleviating the need of animal trials and providing useful information for optimal experiment design and drug dosing. We recently presented a type 2 diabetes (T2D) simulator as tool for in silico testing of new molecules and guiding treatment optimization. Here we present a user-friendly interface aimed to increase the usability of the simulator. The simulator, based on a large-scale glucose, insulin, and C-peptide model and equipped with 100 virtual subjects well describing system dynamics in a real T2D population, is extended to incorporate pharmacokineticspharmacodynamics (PKPD) of a drug of interest. A graphical interface is developed on top of the simulator, allowing an easy design of in silico experiments specifically, it is possible to select the population size to test, design the experiment (crossover or parallel), its duration and the sampling grid, choose glucose and insulin doses, and define treatment PKPD and dose administered. The simulator also provides the outcome metrics requested by the user, and performs statistical comparisons among treatments andor placebo. To illustrate the potential of the simulator, we provided a case study using metformin and liraglutide. Literature-based PKPD models of metformin and liraglutide have been incorporated in the simulator, by modulating key drug-sensitive model parameters. An in silico placebo-controlled trial has been done by simulating a three-arm meal tolerance test with subjects receiving placebo, metformin 850 mg, liraglutide 1.80 mg, respectively. The obtained results are in agreement with the clinical evidences, in terms of main glucose, insulin, and C-peptide outcome metrics. We developed a user-friendly software interface for the T2D simulator to support the design and test of new antidiabetic drugs and treatments. This increases the simulator usability, making it suitable also for users who have low experience with computer programming.",

A meta-analysis performed using the RevMan 5.4.1 software evaluations was completed. We identified 1217 reports after exclusions, eight trials with a total of 931 patients were eligible for analysis. Compared with RYGB, OAGB had multiple advantageous indexes. Examples include percent of excess weight loss (%EWL) at 12 months (P 0.009), body mass index (BMI) at 2 years (P < 0.00001), early postoperative complication (P 0.04), remission of dyslipidemia (P < 0.0001), and operative time (P < 0.00001).

Current obesity medications are challenged by poor effectiveness, poor patient compliance, and potential side effects. Verapamil is an inhibitor of L-type calcium channels, FDA-approved for the treatment of hypertension. We previously investigated the effect of verapamil on modulating autophagy to treat obesity-associated lipotoxicity. This study aims to develop a verapamil transdermal patch and to evaluate its anti-obesity effects. Verapamil is loaded in biomimetic vascular bundle-like carboxymethyl pullulan-based supramolecular hydrogel patches cross-linked with citric acid and glycerol linkages (CLCMP). The investigation was then carried out to determine the therapeutic effect of verapamil-loaded CLCMP (VeraCLCMP) on diet-induced obese mice. VeraCLCMP hydrogel patches with hierarchically organized and anisotropic pore structures not only improved verapamil bioavailability without modifying its chemical structure but also enhanced verapamil release through the stratum corneum barrier. VeraCLCMP patches exhibit low toxicity and high effectiveness at delivering verapamil into the systemic circulation through the dermis in a sustained manner. Specifically, transdermal administration of this patch into diet-induced obese mice drastically improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and alleviated metabolic derangements associated with MAFLD. Furthermore, we uncovered a distinct molecular mechanism underlying the anti-obesity effects associated with the hepatic NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and autophagic clearance by the veraCLCMP hydrogel patches. The current study provides promising drug delivery platforms for long-term family treatment of chronic diseases, including obesity and metabolic dysfunctions.",

As an antimalarial drug, quinacrine has not been reported for its anti-obesity effect to our knowledge. This study aimed to explore the ability of quinacrine to attenuate obesity. In an in vitro adipogenic model, quinacrine exhibited an outstanding suppression on adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells, mainly by activating the AMPK (Adenosine 5-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway to regulate preadipocytes differentiation and lipid accumulation. In addition, C57BL6N female mice were fed with high-fat diet and high-fructose water for 14 weeks to establish an obesity model, followed by oral administration of quinacrine or orlistat. After 9 weeks of treatment, quinacrine significantly reduced the body weight and energy intake, ameliorated the impaired glucose tolerance and restored the homeostasis of serum lipids. Also, quinacrine improved lipid profile and optimized the expression of AMPK signaling pathway related proteins in livers and adipose tissues of obese mice. Quinacrine reverses obesity through activating AMPK phosphorylation to down-regulate adipogenesis, along with lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. It should be a novel application for the treatment of obesity and its associated diseases.",

Assessment and grouping of changes in WCC between 2016 and 2019 were accomplished through group-based trajectory modelling. Newly diagnosed incidence associated with T2DM was estimated based on varying trajectories of WCC by the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical differences in the incidences of new-onset T2DM among various WCC trajectory groups were examined through log-rank test. The influence of WCC trajectory alterations on the new-onset T2DM was evaluated with a multiparameter Cox (proportional-hazards) model. During a 3-year (2016-2019) period, the T2DM development was noted in 3.14% (249) of the subjects. The trajectory model of WCC change was divided into four groups. For participants with low stability (trajectory 1), medium stability (trajectory 2), medium stability (trajectory 3) and high stability (trajectory 4), the incidence of T2DM was separately 2.2%, 2.62%, 4.82% and 7.4%, respectively. After adjusting for the underlying confounders, new-onset T2DM HRs (95% CIs) for trajectories 3 and 4 were separately 1.94 (1.32 to 2.83) and 3.08 (1.82 to 5.21) compared with the trajectory 1, implying that the T2DM risks were statistically significantly high.

        "input": "Cutaneous lipohypertrophy (LH) is a thickened, rubbery lesion in the subcutaneous tissue following multiple injections performed at the same site, i.e., an incorrect injection technique. It is widespread, averaging 47% of insulin patients worldwide, and has severe direct and indirect consequences. Direct consequences consist mainly of poor metabolic control and frequent hypoglycemic events (HYPOs), and indirect ones of markedly increased healthcare costs related to hospital access due to acute events and long-term disease complications. This observation also holds for Italy, despite the National Health System organization expecting every patient with diabetes to undergo a series of visits by different care team members, each performing a specific treatmenteducation task. Indeed, the recent literature points to poor awareness of LH relevance and metabolic consequences among doctors from general and diabetic hospital wards, with educational deficiencies on correct injection practice in nurses too. The aim was to establish if, to what extent, and by whom they had received training on correct insulin injection techniques, and how many initially received notions had persisted over time. We investigated the possible causes of such a failure from the point of view of 1160 insulin-requiring subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), reporting for the first time to specialized diabetic structures through a validated questionnaire and, in the same patients, we searched for LH by inspectionpalpation according to international guidelines, further confirmed by ultrasound scans. We then analyzed differences in education and injecting behavior between subjects classified as LH or LH- depending on the presence or absence of LH lesions. We documented significant educational gaps, with 50% of patients failing to refer to healthcare professionals and relying on their peers with diabetes, thought to be more experienced in 15% of the cases. Seventy-five percent of LH- patients received education from healthcare providers, while 90% of LH learned from another patient or could not remember how they knew, and 68% of LH versus 52% of LH- (p < 0.01) patients had failed to receive training on injection techniques by healthcare providers. All of this enabled the most disabling features of diabetes from the very beginning of the disease history. This study documents, from the patients point of view, that educational gaps are significant and that, even in initially trained subjects, education on correct injection techniques has a fleeting effect if not regularly recalled. Therefore, to rehabilitate LH patients as soon as possible and prevent LH- patients from inadvertently slipping into the other group, there is an urgent need to educate doctors and nurses repeatedly on the importance of correctly injecting insulin to improve patients knowledge and skills.",

The comparative effect of warfarin over non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) on incident fractures among patients with type 2 diabetes comorbid with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains to be elucidated. This was a retrospective, propensity score-weighted, population-based cohort study of adults with type 2 diabetes and AF who were started on warfarin or NOAC between 2005 and 2019 identified from an electronic database of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority. The primary outcome was a composite of major osteoporotic fractures (hip, clinical vertebral, proximal humerus, and wrist). Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. A total of 15,770 patients with type 2 diabetes comorbid with AF were included (9,288 on NOAC, 6,482 on warfarin). During a median follow-up of 20 months, 551 patients (3.5%) sustained major osteoporotic fractures (201 2.2% in the NOAC group, 350 5.4% in the warfarin group). The adjusted cumulative incidence was lower among NOAC users than warfarin users (HR 0.80 95% CI 0.64, 0.99 P 0.044). Subgroup analyses showed consistent protective effects against major osteoporotic fractures among NOAC users across sex, age, HbA1c, duration of diabetes, and history of severe hypoglycemia compared with warfarin users. NOAC use was associated with a lower risk of major osteoporotic fractures than warfarin use among patients with type 2 diabetes comorbid with AF. NOAC may be the preferred anticoagulant from the perspective of bone health.",

        "input": "(1) Background Recent reports suggest a decrease in the prevalence of depression among people with diabetes and important sex-differences in the association between these conditions, however data from Spain is sparse. We aim to assess trends in the prevalence of depression and in-hospital outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) hospitalized (2011-2020) identifying sex-differences. (2) Methods Using the Spanish national hospital discharge database we analysed the prevalence of depression globally, by sex, and according to the conditions included in the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). We tested factors associated with the presence of depression and with in-hospital mortality (IHM). Time trends in the prevalence of depression and variables independently associated with IHM were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. (3) Results From 2011 to 2020, we identified 5,971,917 hospitalizations of patients with T2DM (5.7% involved depression). The prevalence of depression decreased significantly between 2011 and 2020. The adjusted prevalence of depression was 3.32-fold higher in women than in men (OR 3.32 95%CI 3.3-3.35). The highest prevalence of depression among men and women with T2DM was found among those who also had a diagnosis of obesity, liver disease, and COPD. Older age, higher CCI, pneumonia, and having been hospitalized in 2020 increased the risk of IHM in patients with T2DM and depression. Obesity was a protective factor for IHM in both sexes, with no differences detected for IHM between men and women. Among patients hospitalized with T2DM, concomitant depression was associated with lower IHM than among patients without depression (depression paradox). (4) Conclusions The prevalence of depression decreased over time in both sexes. The prevalence of depression was over three-fold higher in women. Female sex and depression were not associated with higher IHM. Based on our results we recommend that clinicians screen regularly for depression in patients with T2DM, particularly women, younger patients, and those with multiple comorbidities.",

This paper critically reviews the current evidence on effects of vitamin C supplementation and its potential mechanisms in diabetes management. Evidence from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show favourable effects of vitamin C on glycaemic control and blood pressure that may be clinically meaningful, and mixed effects on blood lipids and endothelial function. However, evidence is mostly of low evidence certainty. Emerging evidence is promising for effects of vitamin C supplementation on some diabetes complications, particularly diabetic foot ulcers. However, there is a notable lack of robust and well-designed studies exploring effects of vitamin C as a single compound supplement on diabetes prevention and patient-important outcomes (i.e. prevention and amelioration of diabetes complications). RCTs are also required to investigate potential preventative or ameliorative effects of vitamin C on gestational diabetes outcomes. Oral vitamin C doses of 500-1000 mg per day are potentially effective, safe, and affordable for many individuals with diabetes. However, personalisation of supplementation regimens that consider factors such as vitamin C status, disease status, current glycaemic control, vitamin C intake, redox status, and genotype is important to optimize vitamin Cs therapeutic effects safely. Finally, given a high prevalence of vitamin C deficiency in patients with complications, it is recommended that plasma vitamin C concentration be measured and monitored in the clinic setting.",

A retrospective cohort study was conducted, whereby symptom data were extracted from clinical notes in electronic health records. CRCS (stage II or III) diagnosed between 2007 and 2017 who had diabetes and at least one HbA1c within 8 months of initial chemotherapy were included. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis was used to examine total symptoms by hyperglycemia status (hyperglycemia versus no hyperglycemia). Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify symptom clusters. Two hundred forty-three CRCS met inclusion criteria. CRCS with hyperglycemia (HbA1c â¥ 6.5%) had greater individual symptoms (fatigue and depression) and total number of symptoms than those with no hyperglycemia. Two distinct symptom clusters, with five (nausea, vomiting, constipation, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy) and two symptoms (anxiety and depression), were identified among CRCS with hyperglycemia. These findings indicate that CRCS with diabetes and hyperglycemia had more symptoms and two distinct symptom clusters compared to those with no hyperglycemia. Prospective research studies are needed to examine the role of hyperglycemia in symptoms among CRCS with diabetes.

Outcomes (hALI and sUTI) were identified with electronic algorithms. Incidence rates were estimated by exposure group. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated comparing dapagliflozin to comparator GLDs, using propensity score trimming and stratification to address confounding. The sUTI analyses were conducted separately by sex. In all data sources, hALI and sUTI incidence rates were generally lower in dapagliflozin initiators than comparator GLD initiators.

It is increasingly thought that because of its unique characteristics, T2DM may belong not only to the group of metabolic diseases but also to the group of autoimmune diseases. This is due to the involvement of the immune system in the inflammation that occurs with T2DM. Various pro- and anti-inflammatory substances are secreted, especially cytokines in patients with T2DM. Cytokines secreted by adipose tissue are called adipokines, and leptin, adiponectin, resistin, omentin, TNF-Î±, and IL-6 have been implicated in T2DM. In cats, approximately 90% of diabetic cases are T2DM. Risk factors include older age, male sex, Burmese breed, presence of obesity, and insulin resistance.

The ankle mobility is seen to be significantly reduced along with alteration in plantar pressure distribution. Neural mobilization is a neoteric technique that is being used to treat various conditions of neural involvement. It is hypothesized that the application of neural mobilization will improve ankle mobility and plantar pressure distribution in individuals with DPN by restoring the mechanical and neurophysiological functions of the tibial and common peroneal nerves. A single group pre-post, quasi experimental, same subject design will be used. Participants with prior diagnosis of DPN will be selected according to eligibility criteria. The ankle ranges of motion (Both Active Passive) and plantar pressure distribution at six foot regions will be taken as the outcome measures. All the participants will receive neural mobilization of tibial common peroneal nerves (3 sets of 30 repetitions in 2 min with 1 min break in between) for 3 times week for 4 weeks. Outcome measurements will be taken at the baseline and after completion of the intervention. This study will be investigating the possible advantageous effects of neural mobilization in improving ankle joint ranges of motion and plantar pressure distribution in patients with DPN and will help the clinicians and researchers develop preventive measures to reduce the burden of diabetic ulcers.CTRI202204042187 Registered on 27042022.",

        "input": "Type-2 diabetes mellitus is a prime factor for the development of Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) that affects the vital organ, namely the kidneys, and further alters the functions of the nephron system. DN is becoming a challenge for scientists worldwide because of its high pervasiveness and complex medication. Various risk factors are involved in the initiation of pathogenic DN, which are associated with different pathways against drug activity. Due to this, DN becomes an unpredictable query for the researchers. SIRT1, a silent information regulator factor 2 related enzyme 1 (SIRT1), is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) dependent deacetylase that functions as an intracellular regulator of transcriptional activity. An activated version of SIRT-1 improves the diseased metabolic conditions associated with other molecular pathways. SIRT1 attenuates diabetic nephropathy in in vitro and in vivo experimental models of diabetes containing podocytes, mesangial cells, and renal proximal tubular cells. SIRT1 shows nephroprotective effects in DN through deacetylation of transcription factors, i.e., in the disease, like p53, PTP1B, FOXO, RelA, NF- kÎ², STAT-3, and PGC-1Î± PPARÎ³. It has been shown that some natural products like resveratrol and synthetic compounds activate the SIRT1, further involving the cascade pathways to prevent DN. This review will help regarding the effectiveness of SIRT1 as a target in the prevention and treatment of DN.",

        "input": "Diabetes that arises from chronic pancreatitis (CP) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Methods to predict which patients with CP are at greatest risk for diabetes are urgently needed. We aimed to examine independent risk factors for diabetes in a large cohort of patients with CP. This cross-sectional study comprised 645 individuals with CP enrolled in the PROCEED study, of whom 276 had diabetes. We conducted univariable and multivariable regression analyses of potential risk factors for diabetes. Model performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis, and accuracy was evaluated by cross validation. Exploratory analyses were stratified according to the timing of development of diabetes relative to the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Independent correlates of diabetes in CP included risk factors for type 2 diabetes (older age, overweightobese status, male sex, non-White race, tobacco use) as well as pancreatic disease-related factors (history of acute pancreatitis complications, nonalcoholic etiology of CP, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, pancreatic calcification, pancreatic atrophy) (AUROC 0.745). Type 2 diabetes risk factors were predominant for diabetes occurring before pancreatitis, and pancreatic disease-related factors were predominant for diabetes occurring after pancreatitis. Multiple factors are associated with diabetes in CP, including canonical risk factors for type 2 diabetes and features associated with pancreatitis severity. This study lays the groundwork for the future development of models integrating clinical and nonclinical data to identify patients with CP at risk for diabetes and identifies modifiable risk factors (obesity, smoking) on which to focus for diabetes prevention.",

        "input": "Non-communicable diseases (NCD) such as CVD and type 2 diabetes mellitus are major contributors to the burden of disease. NCD are largely driven by modifiable lifestyle factors including poor diet and insufficient physical activity, and consequently, prevention is a public health priority. Although diet and physical activity levels can be improved via lifestyle interventions, long-term adherence to such interventions remains low, which limits their effectiveness. Thus, it is critical to identify the underlying mechanisms that challenge uptake and adherence to such interventions. The current commentary discusses an important, but underexplored, psychological driver of poor adherence to lifestyle interventions, namely, future discounting, which describes the tendency to prefer smaller, short-term rewards over larger, long-term rewards. For example, in the nutrition domain, future discounting refers to valuing the immediate reward of excessive intake of energy-dense, nutrient-poor, discretionary foods high in salt, sugar, and saturated fat, and insufficient intake of low-energy, nutrient-dense, whole foods such as vegetables. Prominent theoretical models propose that excessive future discounting is a major contributor to the development of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. Furthermore, a vast body of evidence suggests that future discounting plays a key role in risk of NCD. Thus, the evidence to date supports the idea that future discounting is an important multi-behaviour target for supporting lifestyle behaviour change however, this approach has been largely neglected in preventive health efforts. Furthermore, this commentary discusses promising techniques (e.g. Episodic Future Thinking) for disrupting future discounting to promote improved adherence to lifestyle interventions aimed at reducing NCD risk.",

Although light-intensity exercise prevents hippocampal memory dysfunction in pre-symptomatic T2DM animals by altering hippocampal lactate transport and neurotrophic factors, the effects of light-intensity exercise in an advanced stage of T2DM animals remain unclear. Here, obob mice, an animal model of T2DM, were subjected to light-intensity exercise (5.0 mmin) for 30 minday, five daysweek for four weeks. The effects of light-intensity exercise on hippocampal complications, mRNA expressions of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT), and miRNA levels were assessed. The light-intensity exercise improved hippocampal memory retention in obob mice. Downregulated hippocampal Mct2 mRNA levels in T2DM were improved with light-intensity exercise. Hippocampal mRNA levels of Mct1 and Mct4 were unchanged within groups. Based on miRNA sequencing, sedentary obob mice exhibited that 71 miRNAs were upregulated, and 77 miRNAs were downregulated in the hippocampus. In addition, the exercise significantly increased 24 miRNAs and decreased 4 miRNAs in the T2DM hippocampus. The exercise reversed T2DM-induced alterations of hippocampal 9 miRNAs, including miR-200a-3p. Our findings imply that miR-200a-3pMct2 in the hippocampus would be a possible clinical target for treating T2DM-induced memory dysfunction.",

Furthermore, we used Cox regression analysis to explore the predictive value of the K-W nodule for the risk of ESKD. Compared with DKD patients without K-W nodules, patients with K-W nodules had a significantly higher level of proteinuria 5.1(3.1, 8.0) g24 hr vs. 2.4(1.1, 4.4) g24 hr, p < 0.001. Patients with K-W nodules had significantly higher interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) and arteriosclerosis scores than those without (p 0.001 and p 0.006). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the probability of developing ESKD was significantly higher in patients with K-W nodules than in those without (log-rank test, p < 0.001). However, after adjusting closer variables, the K-W nodule was not an independent predictor for the risk of ESKD (p > 0.05).

Participants with GLMDs had higher levels of SELENOP than those without GLMDs (standardized mean difference 0.84, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.51), and the SELENOP levels were positively correlated with the markers of GLMDs (pooled effect size 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.15). Subgroup analyses showed that the SELENOP concentrations were higher in women with GD and lower in individuals with MetS than their counterparts, respectively. Moreover, SELENOP was positively correlated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but not with the other markers of GLMDs.

        "input": "Type 2 diabetes is a disease that causes numerous complications disrupting the functioning of the entire body. Therefore, new treatments for the disease are being sought. Studies in recent years have shown that forkhead box O (FOXO) proteins may be a promising target for diabetes therapy. FOXO proteins are transcription factors involved in numerous physiological processes and in various pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Their roles include regulating the cell cycle, DNA repair, influencing apoptosis, glucose metabolism, autophagy processes and ageing. FOXO1 is an important regulator of pancreatic beta-cell function affecting pancreatic beta cells under conditions of insulin resistance. FOXO1 also protects beta cells from damage resulting from oxidative stress associated with glucose and lipid overload. FOXO has been shown to affect a number of processes involved in the development of diabetes and its complications. FOXO regulates pancreatic Î²-cell function during metabolic stress and also plays an important role in regulating wound healing. Therefore, the pharmacological regulation of FOXO proteins is a promising approach to developing treatments for many diseases, including diabetes mellitus. In this review, we describe the role of FOXO proteins in the pathogenesis of diabetes and the role of the modulation of FOXO function in the therapy of this disease.",

We aimed to evaluate the application of machine learning to clinical trials of patients without and with type 2 diabetes to define the personalised cardiovascular benefit of intensive control of systolic blood pressure. In SPRINT, a trial of intensive (systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg) versus standard (systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg) systolic blood pressure control in patients without type 2 diabetes, we defined a phenotypic representation of the study population using 59 baseline variables. We extracted personalised treatment effect estimates for the primary outcome, time-to-first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and acute decompensated heart failure), through iterative Cox regression analyses providing average hazard ratio (HR) estimates weighted for the phenotypic distance of each participant from the index patient of each iteration. Next, we trained an extreme gradient boosting algorithm (known as XGBoost) to predict the personalised effect of intensive systolic blood pressure control using features most consistently linked to increased personalised benefit, before evaluating its performance in the ACCORD BP trial of patients with type 2 diabetes randomly assigned to receive intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control. We stratified patients based on their predicted treatment effect, and key demographic groups (age, sex, cardiovascular disease, and smoking). We assessed the presence of heterogeneity with an interaction test, and assessed the performance of the algorithm in a simulation analysis of SPRINT in the presence or absence of an artificially introduced heterogeneous treatment effect. From SPRINT, we included all 9361 study participants (mean age 67Â·9 years SD 9Â·4, 3332 35Â·6% female) who underwent randomisation to either intensive (n4678) or standard (n4683) treatment. The median individualised HR for MACE was 0Â·63 (IQR 0Â·53-0Â·78). An eight-feature tool built for this analysis to predict personalised benefit in SPRINT was externally tested in ACCORD BP (4733 participants (mean age 62Â·7 years SD 6Â·7, 2258 47Â·7% female), wherein it successfully identified individuals with differential benefit from intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control (adjusted HR for MACE of 0Â·70 95% CI 0Â·55-0Â·90 in individuals with above-median MACE benefit versus 1Â·05 95% CI 0Â·84-1Â·32 for below-median predicted benefit p By use of machine learning to define an individuals personalised benefit through phenotypic representations of clinical trials, we created a practical tool for individualising the selection of intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control in patients without and with type 2 diabetes.

This prospective observational study aims to propose an early prediction model of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy among obese women, through the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) at the first trimester, thus allowing early recognition of obese women that are at risk to develop gestational hypertension, in order to target preventive interventions. Singleton obese women (BMI â¥ 30 kgm2) between the 9th and 12th week of pregnancy were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were chronic diseases, like type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and other medical pre-existing conditions. Eligible women were followed up at 20, 28, and 36 weeks of gestation by measuring blood pressure, weight, and body composition with the use of the BIA. The diagnosis of gestational hypertension was made after the 20th week of gestation. Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were then recorded. Of the 479 women included in the study, 85 (17.7%) developed gestational hypertension the remaining 394 (82.3%) resulted to be normotensive. A higher rate of nulliparous women was found in the hypertensive group (50.6% vs. 37.6%, p 0.02), together with a higher rate of induction of labor (55.3% vs. 40.9%, p 0.02) and of small for gestational age (SGA) newborns (12.9% vs. 6.9%, p 0.03). Significant differences emerged in the body composition between the two groups already from the first trimester, indeed women developing gestational hypertension showed elevated values of Total body Mass, FM, FFM, TBW (p < 0.02), and of legs FM, FFM (p < 0.006). At the multivariate logistics regression, the risk of developing gestational hypertension resulted higher in women with elevated total body water levels in the first trimester (OR 1.10 95% CI 1.04 -1.92). The BIA is a rapid, easy, non-invasive, and inexpensive tool to evaluate the body composition of obese pregnant women.
